abstract: |
  Cross-cultural qualitative research faces an unresolved methodological problem. Naive approaches treat culture as a variable producing outcomes. Sophisticated interpretivist critiques (Kleinman, Geertz) reject this essentialism, urging attention to meaning within local moral worlds. Yet meaning-centered comparison retains a problematic structure: it asks how different interpretive frameworks produce different outcomes, positioning meaning as explanatory weight. This article proposes a third position grounded in processual sociology. Drawing on Abbott's critique of General Linear Reality and Clarke's situational analysis, we argue for shifting explanatory weight from meaning to infrastructure. The unit of comparison becomes the sequence: when similar turning points occur across sites, what pathways do different infrastructural configurations make available? This reframing transcends both cultural essentialism and meaning-centered interpretation, offering comparative claims about infrastructure-sequence relationships that travel across domains. We develop the conceptual architecture and illustrate briefly through existing comparative research in culture, organizations, and health.

## [alternative] ABSTRACT

Cross-cultural qualitative research faces a persistent methodological problem: available comparative methods default to quasi-variable thinking, positioning sites as containers of attributes and comparison as correlation of contents with effects. This article distinguishes three positions on culture and comparison. Configurational comparison treats culture as a condition whose presence or absence correlates with outcomes. Interpretive comparison reconstructs culture as a meaning-system, attending to how actors make sense of their worlds. Both positions, despite their apparent opposition, share a common structure: both explain through what actors think, locating explanatory weight in belief, interpretation, meaning. Both remain inside Geertz's web of significance. This article develops a third position: processual comparison. Drawing on Chicago School processual thinking and Abbott's theoretical program, I argue that when similar turning points occur across sites, the sequences that unfold depend not on what actors make of their situations but on what their situations make available. The comparative question becomes: what pathways do different infrastructural configurations make possible? Geertz taught us to read the web; I am proposing we examine the loom. This shift — from meaning to infrastructure, from interpretation to arrangement — offers a comparative method adequate to processual ontology. 

## 1. INTRODUCTION (~1000 words)

Qualitative sociology excels at understanding social life within particular contexts. Ethnographers capture local meaning; grounded theorists build situated concepts; interpretivists reconstruct actors' logics. Yet when researchers turn to comparison across sites, something curious happens: the commitments that make qualitative work powerful often get bracketed. Comparative qualitative researchers know the anxiety well. Reviewers ask: why these sites? Why compare x and y? The fear is always that we are comparing apples to oranges, no matter how carefully we've selected our fruit and its quantity. I argue that we lack the tools to adequately answer these questions. Available methods default to quasi-variable thinking: how do differences in culture or meaning or context produce differences in outcomes? This positions sites as containers of attributes and comparison as correlation of container contents with effects. If social life unfolds processually — through sequences, turning points, and trajectories rather than variables changing along continua — then standard comparative logic systematically distorts our field of vision. We need methods adequate to processual ontology.

This article develops such a method. To clarify what processual comparison requires, I distinguish three positions:

- **Position 1 (Configurational):** Culture as condition. From Ragin's QCA to comparative welfare state research, this approach treats cultural configurations as conditions whose presence or absence correlates with outcomes. The work is rigorous, often Boolean, attentive to complexity. But the logic remains: configurations explain outcomes. Different conditions, different effects.

- **Position 2 (Interpretive Comparison):** Culture is not a condition to be measured but a meaning-system to be reconstructed. From Blumer's insistence that actors act toward things based on the meanings those things have for them, through Lamont's comparative reconstruction of how actors draw symbolic boundaries across national contexts, interpretive sociology recovers what configurational approaches flatten: how meaning emerges through practice, how the "same" situation is constituted differently across contexts. This is genuine methodological achievement — anti-essentialist, attentive to local meaning-making.

Positions 1 and 2 appear opposed but share a common structure: both explain through what actors think. Position 1 treats ideas as conditions that correlate with outcomes; Position 2 treats ideas as webs of significance that constitute experience. Both locate explanatory weight in belief, interpretation, meaning. Geertz taught us to read the "web of significance": both positions remain inside it.

- **Position 3 (Processual Comparison):** Examine the loom. When similar turning points occur across sites, the sequences that unfold depend not on what actors make of their situations but on what their situations make available. Comparison asks: what pathways do different infrastructural configurations — the material-relational arrangements through which action becomes possible — make available?

This position has roots in Chicago School processual thinking; Hughes on careers and "going concerns," Becker on becoming — which Abbott's processual sociology sharpens into explicit theoretical program: turning points that constitute entities, sequences irreducible to variables, linked ecologies through which action unfolds. Abbott draws on Whitehead's process philosophy, where becoming precedes being and events are ontologically primary. Clarke's situational analysis offers methodological traction, mapping the relational configurations that constitute situations. Recent qualitative work increasingly operates in this register, tracing sequences through arrangements rather than meanings through minds, though without explicit comparative theorization.

What remains unspecified is precisely the comparative method. Position 3 does not dismiss the first two but argues they are inadequate for cross-cultural comparison: when we ask *how infrastructures differ across sites?*, we ask a different question than how meanings differ. We shift explanatory weight from interpretation to arrangement. Section 2 develops the three-position framework. Section 3 specifies the architecture of processual comparison: turning points as unit, infrastructure as explanatory focus, sequences as what we compare. Section 4 illustrates through existing comparative research. Section 5 draws out implications for comparative qualitative methodology.


## 2. THREE POSITIONS ON CULTURE AND COMPARISON (~2500 words)

### 2.1 The Variable Problem

Abbott's critique of General Linear Reality names a pervasive logic in social science. Standard research assumes fixed entities with variable attributes, attributes changing incrementally along continua, causation as correlation of variables across cases. Time becomes the neutral medium through which variables change. This logic shapes not just quantitative analysis but how we think about comparison itself: cases differ on measurable dimensions; differences correlate with outcomes; explanation means identifying which variables matter most.

Qualitative sociology has largely moved past crude applications of this logic. Signaling to my own field, no one publishing in premier journals today treats "Italian familism" as a variable producing "family-centered care" as outcome. The interpretivist turn, from Geertz through the cultural sociology of Lamont and Swidler, demolished this essentialism decades ago. Culture is not what groups "have" but what actors "do."

Yet the shadow of variable logic persists. It persists in reviewer comments asking why we chose these sites rather than others, as if sites were cases of underlying configurations. It persists in policy discourse that attributes behavioral differences to cultural traits. It persists in adjacent fields where qualitative methods serve quantitative logics — nursing research measuring "cultural beliefs," management studies comparing "organizational cultures," clinical psychology adapting interventions to "cultural values." And it persists in the structure of comparative questions themselves: when we ask how cultural differences produce outcome differences, we remain within a logic that positions culture as explanatory variable, even if we have refined our understanding of what culture is.

The clearest contemporary examples come from cross-national quantitative research. Gelfand's tight/loose cultural dimensions predict COVID-19 outcomes across 57 nations. Inglehart's World Values Survey plots countries on cultural dimensions that predict democratization. Henrich traces WEIRD psychological profiles to historical-institutional configurations. This work generates important findings at scale. The question is whether its logic travels to qualitative comparison.

Abbott's critique suggests it cannot. If events constitute entities rather than revealing pre-existing differences, then the "Italian caregiver" and the "American caregiver" are not instances of cultural types but emergent through sequences. If turning points create qualitatively new situations rather than incremental changes along continua, then comparing "outcomes" may compare incommensurable things produced through entirely different processes. If sequences matter independently of endpoints, then explaining outcomes through cultural variables misses precisely what qualitative research is positioned to see: how outcomes are produced through process.

The interpretivist tradition responded to this problem. The question is whether it solved it.

Ragin's Qualitative Comparative Analysis represents the most rigorous attempt to escape variable logic while retaining systematic comparison. QCA replaces correlational thinking with set-theoretic logic: cases are configurations of conditions, causation works through necessity and sufficiency rather than net effects, equifinality allows multiple pathways to similar outcomes. This is genuine methodological innovation. Ragin knows the problem.

Yet QCA remains synchronic. It asks: what configurations of conditions are present when we observe the outcome? The truth table captures conditions at a moment. Different configurations may produce the same outcome (equifinality), but "configurations" here means combinations of conditions present, not temporal sequences through which outcomes emerge. When Ragin identifies multiple pathways, he means multiple configurations — not pathways in the processual sense of unfolding through time.

The comparative question persists in altered form: which configurations of conditions are sufficient for the outcome? This is more sophisticated than asking which variables correlate with outcomes. But it still treats comparison as a matter of identifying what's present rather than tracing what unfolds. The loom's current state is mapped; what happens when thread arrives remains unexamined.

Two responses to the variable problem emerged. One, represented by Ragin, refines the logic of conditions while bracketing temporal process. The other, the interpretivist tradition, shifts from conditions to meanings while retaining the explanatory question: how do different meaning-systems produce different outcomes? The question is whether either solves the comparative problem for qualitative research attentive to process.

### 2.2 Position 2: The Interpretive Critique

A powerful response emerges from interpretive social science. Geertz's thick description insists on understanding meaning within webs of significance. Kleinman and Benson's (2006) critique of cultural competency argues that treating culture as fixed traits essentializes and stereotypes. Culture is not what people "have" but how they make meaning.

This critique is necessary. It demolishes naive ideas of medical authority developing 'cultural competence.' But it does not resolve a comparative problem but transforms it.

[TO DEVELOP:]

The interpretive move shifts from "what cultural traits explain this" to "what meanings explain this." When Lamont compares how French and American workers draw symbolic boundaries, she's not treating culture as a variable. She's reconstructing meaning-systems. But the comparative question remains: how do different meaning-systems produce different boundary-drawing?

The structure persists: sites contain different interpretive frameworks; comparison examines how these frameworks produce different outcomes. The explanatory weight stays on meaning.

**The regress problem:** To compare meanings across sites, we need equivalence—assurance we're comparing "the same" phenomenon interpreted differently. But if meanings constitute phenomena, there may be no meaning-independent "same" to compare. We are always already within that interpretive frameworks.

**The transportability problem:** Meaning-centered findings don't travel well. "French workers interpret dignity through X while American workers interpret it through Y" is a finding about those workers in those contexts. While qualitative inquiry should not necessarily be concerned with the portability of findings, as our research is instrinsically situated within the sites and sources in which we conduct it - its validity being internal, and its findings to be operationalized and generalized by others, interpretivist framing inherently conjures a world vision, a localized phenomena whose explanatory power is as significant inasmuch as it resonates with readers. 

Our research has focused so profoundly on 'outcomes', that we have glossed over precisely how those outcomes are produced sequentially; and that illustrating a mechanism in our study is our closest indicator of the black box's interior. 

The interpretive turn, from Geertz through Kleinman, shifts attention from the web-as-object to the weaving-as-practice. Culture is not a pattern people "have" but a process of meaning-making they engage in. When Lamont reconstructs how French and American workers draw symbolic boundaries, she doesn't treat "French culture" as a variable. She shows how actors weave meaning within their local contexts, how they interpret dignity and worth through available cultural threads. The critique of cultural competency models follows: don't treat culture as fixed traits to be catalogued; attend to how people make meaning within their worlds.

This move is necessary. It demolishes naive essentialism and recovers the actor as weaver rather than mere bearer of cultural patterns. But it transforms the comparative problem rather than resolving it. The question becomes: how do different meaning-systems produce different weavings? The explanatory weight remains on interpretation—on how actors make sense of their threads. We've moved from comparing finished textiles to comparing weaving practices, but we still explain outcomes through meaning. The loom itself—the apparatus that makes certain weavings possible and forecloses others—remains in the background. We watch weavers at work but don't examine what constrains and enables their movements.

### 2.3 Abbott's Processual Sociology

Abbott's critique of General Linear Reality provides resources for a third position.

Standard social science assumes:
- Fixed entities with variable attributes
- Attributes changing incrementally along continua
- Causation as correlation of variables across cases
- Time as medium in which variables change

But social life works differently:
- Events constitute entities (a "diagnosed patient" didn't exist before diagnosis)
- Turning points create qualitatively new situations, not incremental changes
- Sequences matter independently of endpoints
- What happens depends on what pathways are available when events occur

[TO DEVELOP: Abbott's linked ecologies, turning points, narrative positivism]


The implications for comparison: if then turning points constitute entities, then comparing "outcomes" across sites may compare incommensurable things. The "same" phenomenon may be constituted through entirely different sequences. 

Abbott's processual sociology directs us to the loom. When new thread arrives—a diagnosis, a crisis, a threshold crossing—the patterns available depend not on how the weaver interprets the thread but on the loom's configuration. The heddles and harnesses, the warp already set, the mechanical possibilities of the apparatus: these determine what sequences of movement can produce what patterns. Same thread through different looms yields different textiles. Different weavers at the same loom produce similar patterns because infrastructure constrains and enables.

This reframes comparison entirely. We ask not "how do different cultures produce different patterns" (Position 1) or "how do actors weave meaning differently" (Position 2) but "what looms make what weavings possible." When a turning point occurs—new thread arrives—the sequences that unfold depend on infrastructural configuration: what institutional interfaces must be navigated, what relational ties can be activated, what material resources exist, what pathways stand open. Actors may interpret their threads similarly yet weave different patterns because they work at different looms. Actors may interpret threads differently yet weave similar patterns because the same loom constrains their movements.

The loom is not a metaphor for determinism. Weavers act; they choose threads, vary tension, make mistakes and corrections. But they act within and through an apparatus that makes some sequences available and others impossible. For comparative purposes, examining the loom explains more than interpreting the weaver. Geertz taught us to read the web; we are saying: examine the loom.


Recent qualitative work increasingly operates in this register, even without explicit methodological theorization. Desmond's *Evicted* traces how housing precarity initiates sequences that cascade through employment, kinship, and health — eviction as turning point, landlord-tenant-court configurations as infrastructure. Auyero's *Patients of the State* examines how waiting itself becomes infrastructural, the temporal arrangements of bureaucracies shaping what sequences are available to the poor. Kohler-Hausmann's *Misdemeanorland* shows how the procedural infrastructure of courts — not meanings actors attach to justice — determines which legal sequences unfold. Miller's *Halfway Home* follows how carceral infrastructure extends beyond prison walls, channeling reentry sequences through probation offices, halfway houses, and labor markets that constrain pathways regardless of individual intent.

In urban ethnography, Stuart's *Ballad of the Bullet* and *Down, Out, and Under Arrest* attend to how neighborhood configurations and policing infrastructures make certain trajectories available while foreclosing others. Duck's *No Way Out* traces how the relational ecology of a single block shapes sequences of violence and survival. Bell's work on legal estrangement shows how institutional arrangements — not cultural attitudes toward law — produce systematic distrust. Hoang's *Spiderweb Capitalism* follows how financial infrastructures channel investment sequences across borders.

These researchers share an intuition: trace sequences through arrangements, not meanings through minds. But the comparative extension remains underdeveloped. What would it mean to compare Desmond's Milwaukee eviction sequences with housing precarity elsewhere — not as different "cultures of poverty" but as different infrastructural configurations producing different sequential pathways?

### 2.4 Position 3: Processual Comparison

The third position shifts explanatory weight from meaning to infrastructure.

**Infrastructure** names what makes sequences possible: relational configurations, institutional interfaces, material arrangements, available pathways. Not what actors believe but what pathways open when turning points occur.

**Turning points** are the unit of comparison. Not "how do sites differ in outcome Y" but "when similar turning points occur, what sequences unfold?"

**Sequences** are what we compare. Not meanings attached to situations but pathways taken through them.

The key move: actors in different sites may hold similar interpretive frameworks yet follow different sequences because different infrastructures make different pathways available. Conversely, actors holding different meanings may follow similar sequences because infrastructures channel possibilities similarly.

For comparative purposes, infrastructure explains more than meaning.

### 2.5 The Three Positions Compared

| | Unit of Analysis | Explanatory Weight | Comparative Question | Claim Structure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Position 1 | Cultural trait | Culture as variable | How do cultural differences produce outcome differences? | Culture X → Outcome Y |
| Position 2 | Meaning-system | Interpretation | How do different meanings shape experience? | Meaning M → Experience E |
| Position 3 | Sequence | Infrastructure | What sequences do infrastructures make available? | Infrastructure I → Sequence S available |

Position 3 doesn't deny that meanings matter for experience. It argues that for comparative explanation, infrastructure matters more than meaning.


## 3. THE ARCHITECTURE OF PROCESSUAL COMPARISON (~2000 words)

### 3.1 Turning Points as Unit

Comparison begins with turning points: moments when sequences branch, entities emerge, possibilities open or close.

[TO DEVELOP:]

- Diagnosis, transition, crisis, threshold—events that constitute new situations
- Not incremental change but qualitative shift
- The "same" turning point type can be identified across sites without assuming meaning-equivalence
- We compare not how turning points are interpreted but what sequences they initiate

Examples from existing literature showing turning points constituting entities:
- Becker's marijuana user "becoming" through sequence of experiences
- Goffman's moral career and status passages
- Vaughan's mistake sequences in organizations

### 3.2 Infrastructure as Explanatory Focus

Infrastructure names what makes sequences possible:

**Relational ecology:** What ties exist? What can be activated? Through what channels? (cf. Small on organizational ties, Desmond on relational poverty)

**Institutional interfaces:** What formal systems must be navigated? What scripts do they impose? What gatekeeping occurs?

**Material arrangements:** Physical, technological, economic resources that enable or constrain pathways

**Narrative resources:** Available cultural scripts that make transitions intelligible (these matter, but as infrastructure—available pathways—not as explanatory meanings)

[TO DEVELOP: How Clarke's situational analysis maps infrastructure]

The shift from "culture" to "infrastructure":
- Culture implies container of meanings actors hold
- Infrastructure implies configurations that make pathways available
- Same actors + different infrastructure = different sequences
- Different actors + same infrastructure = similar sequences

### 3.3 Sequences as What We Compare

We compare not outcomes but sequences: the pathways that unfold from turning points through infrastructures.

[TO DEVELOP:]

- Sequences have their own logic independent of endpoints
- Similar endpoints may be reached through different sequences (equifinality)
- Similar starting points may lead to different endpoints depending on infrastructure
- The sequence IS the finding, not a mediator between culture and outcome

### 3.4 The Method Specified

1. Identify comparable turning point types across sites
2. Map infrastructural configurations at each site (Clarke's situational analysis)
3. Trace sequences forward: what pathways open? What entities emerge?
4. Compare sequences, not outcomes
5. Theorize infrastructure-sequence relationships

## 4. ILLUSTRATIONS FROM EXISTING RESEARCH (~1500 words)

[Each illustration: ~400 words. Show how existing comparative work operates in Position 1 or 2, then sketch what Position 3 would reveal. NOT extended empirical demonstration—brief analytical engagement.]

### 4.1 Comparative Culture: Lamont's Boundary Work

Lamont's comparative research on symbolic boundaries (French vs. American workers, Black vs. White professionals) represents sophisticated Position 2 work. She reconstructs meaning-systems, showing how different cultural repertoires enable different boundary-drawing.

[TO DEVELOP:]

What processual comparison would add: When workers encounter status threats (turning point), what sequences unfold? The question shifts from "how do French workers interpret dignity differently" to "what infrastructural configurations (labor markets, credential systems, workplace organization) make what response-sequences available?" Workers may share similar meaning-frameworks yet follow different sequences because different pathways exist.

### 4.2 Organizational Analysis: Vaughan's Mistake Sequences

Vaughan's work on the Challenger disaster and other organizational failures examines how mistakes become normalized through sequences of events.

[TO DEVELOP:]

This is already closer to Position 3—attention to sequences, not just meanings. But comparison across organizations could be strengthened: when similar anomaly-signals occur (turning point), what infrastructural configurations make what response-sequences available? Not "organizational culture" as explanation but infrastructure (reporting channels, meeting structures, authority relations) as pathway.

### 4.3 Health and Inequality: Small and Desmond on Relational Poverty

Small's work on childcare centers and social capital, Desmond's relational poverty analysis—both attend to how ties enable or constrain action.

[TO DEVELOP:]

These approaches gesture toward infrastructure without fully theorizing it. When resource needs arise (turning point), what relational configurations make what sequences available? The comparison is infrastructural: not different meanings attached to poverty but different tie configurations that make different pathways possible.

### 4.4 Brief Gesture: Author's Cross-Cultural Research

The framework developed here emerged from the author's comparative research on caregiving and migration across Italy and the United States. When similar turning points occurred (diagnosis, documentation crisis, care threshold), different infrastructural configurations—kinship ecologies, bureaucratic interfaces, network availability—made different sequences available, regardless of meaning-systems actors inhabited.[^1]

## 5. IMPLICATIONS (~1500 words)

### 5.1 For Comparative Method

[TO DEVELOP:]

**Site selection:** Not "most different/similar systems" but infrastructurally varied sites facing comparable turning points

**Data collection:** Trace sequences from turning points, map infrastructures (Clarke), attend to pathways not just meanings

**Analysis:** Compare sequences through infrastructures, not meanings across sites

**Claims:** Infrastructure-sequence relationships, transportable across domains

### 5.2 For Theory Construction

[TO DEVELOP:]

Position 3 claims are different in kind:
- Not correlational (culture X → outcome Y)
- Not interpretive (meaning M → experience E)
- But mechanistic: infrastructure I makes sequence S available

These claims travel because infrastructure-sequence relationships should operate wherever similar configurations appear, regardless of local meaning-systems.

### 5.3 For the Interpretive Tradition

[TO DEVELOP:]

We're not abandoning interpretation. Meaning matters for understanding experience. But for comparative explanation, infrastructure does more work. This is a division of labor:
- Interpretive analysis: how do actors make sense of their situations?
- Processual comparison: what sequences do infrastructures make available?

Both are legitimate. But they answer different questions.

### 5.4 For Intervention

[TO DEVELOP:]

The three positions imply different intervention logics:

**Position 1:** Change cultural beliefs/values
**Position 2:** Attend to local meanings, avoid imposing external frameworks  
**Position 3:** Redesign infrastructure—alter what pathways are available when turning points occur

Position 3 suggests sustainable change requires infrastructural intervention, not (only) cultural competence or meaning-sensitivity.

### 5.5 Limitations

[TO DEVELOP:]

- When is meaning-centered analysis still appropriate?
- Risk of infrastructural determinism
- Difficulty specifying "same" turning point across contexts
- Resource-intensiveness of mapping infrastructure

---

## 6. CONCLUSION (~500 words)

[TO DEVELOP:]

Qualitative sociology's comparative methods remain underdeveloped. The default is variable logic or meaning-centered interpretation. Neither is adequate to processual ontology.

This article proposed a third position: comparing sequences through infrastructures. The shift is from meaning to pathway, from interpretation to configuration, from what actors believe to what pathways exist.

The contribution is methodological: a way of comparing that honors processual ontology while enabling transportable claims. When similar turning points occur, what sequences do different infrastructures make available? This question can be asked across domains, generating cumulative knowledge about infrastructure-sequence relationships.

The intervention extends rather than dismisses the interpretive tradition. Kleinman was right to reject cultural essentialism. But meaning-centered comparison faces its own limits. Processual comparison offers a way forward.
