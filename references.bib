  abstract = {This article develops a concept of lyrical sociology, a sociology I oppose to narrative sociology, by which I mean standard quantitative inquiry with its ``narratives'' of variables as well as those parts of qualitative sociology that take a narrative and explanatory approach to social life. Lyrical sociology is characterized by an engaged, nonironic stance toward its object of analysis, by specific location of both its subject and its object in social space, and by a momentaneous conception of social time. Lyrical sociology typically uses strong figuration and personification, and aims to communicate its author's emotional stance toward his or her object of study, rather than to ``explain'' that object. The analysis considers many examples and draws on literary criticism, the philosophy of time, and the theory of emotion. It also addresses contemporary debates in ethnography.},

When does what doesn't happen mean as much, if not more, than what does? Andrew Abbott considers these fascinating questions in Time Matters, a diverse series of essays that constitutes the most extensive analysis of temporality in social science today. Ranging from abstract theoretical reflection to pointed methodological critique, Abbott demonstrates the inevitably theoretical character of any methodology.Time Matters focuses particularly on questions of time, events, and causality. Abbott grounds each essay in straightforward examinations of actual social scientific analyses. Throughout, he demonstrates the crucial assumptions we make about causes and events, about actors and interaction and about time and meaning every time we employ methods of social analysis, whether in academic disciplines, market research, public opinion polling, or even evaluation research. Turning current assumptions on their heads, Abbott not only outlines the theoretical orthodoxies of empirical social science, he sketches new alternatives, laying down foundations for a new body of social theory.},

This reality assumes (1) that the social world consists of fixed entities with variable attributes, (2) that cause cannot flow from "small" to "large" attributes/events, (3) that causal attributes have only one causal pattern at once, (4) that the sequence of events does not influence their outcome, (5) that the "careers" of entities are largely independent, and (6) that causal attributes are generally independent of each other. The paper discusses examples of these assumptions in empirical work, consider standard and new methods addressing them, and briefly explores alternative models for reality that employ demographic, sequential, and network perspectives.},

Culture-related factors such as normative beliefs, knowledge and behaviours have also been shown to be associated with health status. The role and function of cultural resources in the unequal distribution of health is addressed. Drawing on the work of French Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, the concept of cultural capital for its contribution to the current understanding of social inequalities in health is explored. It is suggested that class related cultural resources interact with economic and social capital in the social structuring of people's health chances and choices. It is concluded that cultural capital is a key element in the behavioural transformation of social inequality into health inequality. New directions for empirical research on the interplay between economic, social and cultural capital are outlined.},

Yet, at present, researchers seeking to design comparative field projects have few scholarly works detailing how comparison is conducted in divergent ethnographic approaches. In Beyond the Case, Corey M. Abramson and Neil Gong have gathered together several experts in field research to address these issues by showing how practitioners employing contemporary iterations of ethnographic traditions such as phenomenology, grounded theory, positivism, and interpretivism, use comparison in their works. The contributors connect the long history of comparative (and anti-comparative) ethnographic approaches to their contemporary uses. By honing in on how ethnographers render sites, groups, or cases analytically commensurable and comparable, Beyond the Case offers a new lens for examining the assumptions, payoffs, and potential drawbacks of different forms of comparative ethnography.},

  abstract = {Netnography has become a widely accepted research method. It has been used to tackle a wide variety of topics from culture to identity, social relationships and civic empowerment. Netnography can be broadly defined as a qualitative research approach that adapts the traditional ethnographic techniques to the study of the "net", which is the online communities, practices and cultures formed through computer-mediated communications. Both Ethnography and Netnography are naturalistic and unobtrusive approaches, interested in studying social practices in their everyday context (Kozinets 2010). They are both multi-method, methodologically flexible and adaptive, not confining themselves to following specific procedures, but rather remaining open to issues arising from the field (Varis2016). However, Netnography differs from Ethnography under some crucial points. Entering the online culture diverges from face-to-face entr\'ee in terms of accessibility and research design. From a data collection perspective, Netnography is far less time consuming; however, it requires a new set of skills due to the specificities of computer-mediated communication and its dramatically increased field site accessibility, which requires choices about field sites and decisions about types of data to gather and analyse. Moreover, it is far less intrusive than traditional Ethnography as it allows for researcher invisibility: the cyberspace makes it possible for researchers to be unseen from people observed. This allows documentingthe explicit language of informants without the risk of obtrusiveness and disturbance. This paper presents the methodological specificities of Netnography focusing on its context of the application, the definition of the method, the research design: from the objectives and research questions' setting, to sites' selection and cultural entr\'ee, from the type of data to be collected to the way to classify, analyze and represent them. The paper will also discuss some examples of netnographic studies in social sciences.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Caregiver burden may result from providing care for patients with chronic illness. It can occur in any of the 43.5 million individuals providing support to midlife and older adults. Caregiver burden is frequently overlooked by clinicians. OBJECTIVES: To outline the epidemiology of caregiver burden; to provide strategies to diagnose, assess, and intervene for caregiver burden in clinical practice; and to evaluate evidence on interventions intended to avert or mitigate caregiver burden and related caregiver distress. EVIDENCE: Cohort studies examining the relation between demographic and social risk factors and adverse outcomes of caregiver burden were reviewed. Review of recent meta-analyses to summarize the effectiveness of caregiver burden interventions were identified by searching Ovid MEDLINE, AgeLine, and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: Risk factors for caregiver burden include female sex, low educational attainment, residence with the care recipient, higher number of hours spent caregiving, depression, social isolation, financial stress, and lack of choice in being a caregiver. Practical assessment strategies for caregiver burden exist to evaluate caregivers, their care recipients, and the care recipient's overall caregiving needs. A variety of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions have shown mild to modest efficacy in mitigating caregiver burden and associated manifestations of caregiver distress in high-quality meta-analyses. Psychosocial interventions include support groups or psychoeducational interventions for caregivers of dementia patients (effect size, 0.09-0.23). Pharmacologic interventions include use of anticholinergics or antipsychotic medications for dementia or dementia-related behaviors in the care recipient (effect size, 0.18-0.27). Many studies showed improvements in caregiver burden-associated symptoms (eg, mood, coping, self-efficacy) even when caregiver burden itself was minimally improved. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Physicians have a responsibility to recognize caregiver burden. Caregiver assessment and intervention should be tailored to the individual circumstances and contexts in which caregiver burden occurs.},

  abstract = {Introduction The projected growth of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD) cases by midcentury has expanded the research field and impelled new lines of inquiry into structural and social determinants of health (S/SDOH) as fundamental drivers of disparities in AD/ADRD. Methods In this review, we employ Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory as a framework to posit how S/SDOH impact AD/ADRD risk and outcomes. Results Bronfenbrenner defined the ``macrosystem'' as the realm of power (structural) systems that drive S/SDOH and that are the root cause of health disparities. These root causes have been discussed little to date in relation to AD/ADRD, and thus, macrosystem influences, such as racism, classism, sexism, and homophobia, are the emphasis in this paper. Discussion Under Bronfenbrenner's macrosystem framework, we highlight key quantitative and qualitative studies linking S/SDOH with AD/ADRD, identify scientific gaps in the literature, and propose guidance for future research. Highlights Ecological systems theory links structural/social determinants to AD/ADRD. Structural/social determinants accrue and interact over the life course to impact AD/ADRD. Macrosystem is made up of societal norms, beliefs, values, and practices (e.g., laws). Most macro-level determinants have been understudied in the AD/ADRD literature.},

  abstract = {Enrollment in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) has greatly increased in recent years. Policy makers and other stakeholders need the best available evidence about how these plans may affect health care cost and utilization, but the literature has not been comprehensively synthesized. We performed a systematic review of methodologically rigorous studies that examined the impact of HDHPs on health care utilization and costs. The plans were associated with a significant reduction in preventive care in seven of twelve studies and a significant reduction in office visits in six of eleven studies?which in turn led to a reduction in both appropriate and inappropriate care. Furthermore, bivariate analyses of data extracted from the included studies suggested that the plans may be associated with a reduction in appropriate preventive care and medication adherence. Current evidence suggests that HDHPs are associated with lower health care costs as a result of a reduction in the use of health services, including appropriate services.},

Objective~           This systematic review aimed to describe the current evidence and gaps in the literature on measures used to assess CVD outcomes in family caregivers, the association of caregiving with CVD incidence/risk outcomes, and associated factors in family caregivers of patients with chronic disease.           Methods~           Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for English-language, peer-reviewed studies published from 2008 to 2020 that examined CVD incidence and risk among family caregivers of adults with chronic conditions.           Results~           Forty-one studies were included in this review. The measures used to assess CVD risk were categorized into biochemical, subclinical markers, components of metabolic syndrome, and global risk scores. Compared with noncaregivers, caregivers were more likely to have higher CVD incidence rates and objectively measured risk. Cardiovascular disease risks were also increased by their caregiving experience, including hours/duration of caregiving, caregivers' poor sleep status, psychological symptoms, poor engagement in physical/leisure activities, and care recipient's disease severity.           Conclusions~           Although there were limited longitudinal studies in caregivers of patients with diverse health conditions, we found evidence that caregivers are at high risk of CVD. Further research for various caregiver groups using robust methods of measuring CVD risk is needed. Caregiver factors should be considered in developing interventions aimed at reducing CVD risk for caregivers.},

We determine if family caregiving at the end of life is associated with place of death in the United States and Europe.We use the Harmonized End of Life data sets developed by the Gateway to Global Aging Data for the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We conducted multinomial logistic regression on 7,113 decedents from 18 European countries and 3,031 decedents from the United States to determine if family caregiving, defined based on assistance with activities of daily living, was associated with death at home versus at a hospital or nursing home.Family caregiving was associated with reduced odds of dying in a hospital and nursing home, relative to dying at home in both the United States and Europe. Care from a spouse/partner or child/grandchild was both more common and more strongly associated with place of death than care from other relatives. Associations between family caregiving and place of death were generally consistent across European welfare regimes.This cross-national examination of family caregiving indicates that family-based support is universally important in determining where older adults die. In both the United States and in Europe, most care provided during a long-term illness or disability is provided by family caregivers, and it is clear families exert tremendous influence on place of death.},

  abstract = {Recent research has suggested that financial transfers from parents to their adult children in the family are less likely to take place but more intense---i.e. for larger amounts---in the Southern European countries than in the Nordic ones, with the Continental European countries falling in-between the two. What remains to be examined is the variation among regimes in the social mechanisms regulating these transfers. Using data from the first wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), this article shows that financial transfers have different aims and meanings across the regimes. In Southern Europe, parents support their children mainly through co-residence, and little economic support passes the walls of the house. In the Nordic countries, in contrast, parent--child co-residence is non-normative. Children leave their parents' home early and then receive direct and explicit help from them. The Continental countries fall in-between.},

  abstract = {Although older migrants in Southern Europe are increasing in number, relatively little attention has been paid to their care needs and resources. The availability of informal care is an important determinant of wellbeing in later life and norms regulating filial obligations have an important role in affecting the quality and quantity of support received. Using data from a qualitative survey conducted in Italy, this article sheds light on the social norms regulating filial obligations towards older parents among natives and three groups of immigrants: Maghrebis, Chinese and Filipinos. The results indicate a number of commonalities between the four different groups considered, such as: the principle of delayed reciprocity at the basis of filial support obligations; a gender bias in attributing the most psychologically, physically and time-demanding caring obligations to adult daughters and daughters-in-law; and a preference for intergenerational residential autonomy shared by Italian, Filipinos and, to a lesser extent, Maghrebi respondents. At the same time, numerous differences emerge between natives and immigrants, and between immigrant groups. The most significant differences are observed regarding: the possibility of resorting to a paid care-giver, which is more common among Italians and, to a lesser extent, Filipino respondents; and a stronger gender bias among the Chinese and Maghrebi groups, i.e. they attribute the majority of personal care responsibilities to daughters and daughters-in-law.},

The Special Report discusses consumers' and primary care physicians' perspectives on awareness, diagnosis and treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), including MCI due to Alzheimer's disease. An estimated 6.5 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest year for which data are available. Alzheimer's disease was officially listed as the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States in 2019 and the seventh-leading cause of death in 2020 and 2021, when COVID-19 entered the ranks of the top ten causes of death. Alzheimer's remains the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145\%. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 16 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2021. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at \textbackslash 271.6 billion in 2021. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes --- costs that have been aggravated by COVID-19. Members of the dementia care workforce have also been affected by COVID-19. As essential care workers, some have opted to change jobs to protect their own health and the health of their families. However, this occurs at a time when more members of the dementia care workforce are needed. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are almost three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 22 times as great. Total payments in 2022 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be \textbackslash 321 billion. A recent survey commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association revealed several barriers to consumers' understanding of MCI. The survey showed low awareness of MCI among Americans, a reluctance among Americans to see their doctor after noticing MCI symptoms, and persistent challenges for primary care physicians in diagnosing MCI. Survey results indicate the need to improve MCI awareness and diagnosis, especially in underserved communities, and to encourage greater participation in MCI-related clinical trials.},

This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060, barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or cure AD. Official AD death certificates recorded 120,122 deaths from AD in 2022. Since 2020, when COVID-19 became one of the top 10 causes of death in the United States, AD has ranked as the seventh-leading cause of death. However, 2023 data indicate that Alzheimer's will likely resume its place as the sixth-leading cause of death. Between 2000 and 2022, deaths from stroke, heart disease, and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased by more than 142\%. Nearly 12 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 19.2 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2024. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier and an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at \textbackslash 413.5 billion in 2024. Its costs, however, extend to unpaid caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes. Members of the paid health care and broader community-based workforce are involved in diagnosing, treating, and caring for people with dementia. However, the United States faces growing shortages across many segments of the dementia care workforce due to a combination of factors, including the absolute increase in the number of people living with dementia. Therefore, targeted programs and care delivery models are urgently needed to attract, better train, and effectively deploy health care and community-based workers to provide dementia care. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are almost three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 22 times as great. Total payments in 2025 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be \textbackslash 384 billion. The Special Report examines Americans' thoughts about new developments in diagnosing and treating AD. Based on survey results, most Americans believe early detection of Alzheimer's is important, and nearly all would want a simple diagnostic test if it were available to allow for early diagnosis and treatment. About two-thirds of Americans are aware that new medications exist to slow the progression of AD, and most feel optimistic about the future of new Alzheimer's treatments over the next decade.},

  abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the term used to describe the use of computers and technology to simulate intelligent behavior and critical thinking comparable to a human being. John McCarthy first described the term AI in 1956 as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines. Objective: This descriptive article gives a broad overview of AI in medicine, dealing with the terms and concepts as well as the current and future applications of AI. It aims to develop knowledge and familiarity of AI among primary care physicians. Materials and Methods: PubMed and Google searches were performed using the key words `artificial intelligence'. Further references were obtained by cross-referencing the key articles. Results: Recent advances in AI technology and its current applications in the field of medicine have been discussed in detail. Conclusions: AI promises to change the practice of medicine in hitherto unknown ways, but many of its practical applications are still in their infancy and need to be explored and developed better. Medical professionals also need to understand and acclimatize themselves with these advances for better healthcare delivery to the masses.},

  abstract = {Objective This study uses a life course perspective to investigate Black--White disparities in how nuclear family structures (i.e., parents' romantic union statuses and coresidential arrangements with children) are linked with postsecondary financial transfers. Background In the United States, both parents' nuclear family experiences and postsecondary transfers are stratified along racial lines. Prior research suggests that racial disparities in nuclear family experiences, however, are not key drivers of the gap in parental postsecondary transfers. The small role that nuclear family structure plays in shaping the Black--White gap in postsecondary transfers may result from heterogeneity in the consequences of such structures across racial groups, though this heterogeneity remains untested. Method Using the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/) and sequence analysis techniques, this study documents seven common family trajectories experienced by American parents (N = 7289). It employs two-part models to assess whether the association between parents' trajectories and the likelihood/magnitude of postsecondary transfers differs for Black and White parents. Results Results suggest that White parents who are continuously in two-biological-parent families or who experience long-term re-partnering are more likely to make postsecondary transfers than Black parents in similar family trajectories. These racial disparities, however, disappear when parents experience trajectories marked by singlehood or nonresidence with children. Conclusions Nuclear family structures matter less for structuring transfers for Black parents in part because gains from romantic partnerships are concentrated among Whites. Implications for reproductions of racial inequalities are discussed.},

Despite medical advances, there is still no cure for dementia, and as elderly individuals succumb to Alzheimer's Disease or related dementia, more and more people are having to care their elderly parents and /or siblings. Profiles in Caregiving is practical source of information for anyone who teaches caregiving, acts as a caregiver, or studies caregiving. This book discusses recent research on stress factors associated with caregiving, and what factors impact on successful versus non-successful adaptation to the care-giving role. This is an expanding field in gerontology, and is also of interest to personality and social psychologists studying stress and interpersonal relations. Although there are many books on the cause and treatment of dementia, there has been a book that provides a research investigation into the factors associated with effective caregiving to dementia patients. Conceptualizes caregiving as a multistage career whose impact on the caregiver continues to be felt after in-home care has ceased Based upon a longitudinal survey of a demographically diverse sample of principal caregivers over a three-year period Identifies caregivers who are most at-risk for adverse adaptation to the role Describes preventative and clinical intervention strategies Identifies post-care risk and issues Identifies antecedents to successful adaptation State of the art analytic techniques Graphic presentation of empirical findings Renowned multidisciplinary research team},

  abstract = {During her two decades at The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Marcia Angell had a front-row seat on the appalling spectacle of the pharmaceutical industry. She watched drug companies stray from their original mission of discovering and manufacturing useful drugs and instead become vast marketing machines with unprecedented control over their own fortunes. She saw them gain nearly limitless influence over medical research, education, and how doctors do their jobs. She sympathized as the American public, particularly the elderly, struggled and increasingly failed to meet spiraling prescription drug prices. Now, in this bold, hard-hitting new book, Dr. Angell exposes the shocking truth of what the pharmaceutical industry has become--and argues for essential, long-overdue change.Currently Americans spend a staggering \$200 billion each year on prescription drugs. As Dr. Angell powerfully demonstrates, claims that high drug prices are necessary to fund research and development are unfounded: The truth is that drug companies funnel the bulk of their resources into the marketing of products of dubious benefit. Meanwhile, as profits soar, the companies brazenly use their wealth and power to push their agenda through Congress, the FDA, and academic medical centers.Zeroing in on hugely successful drugs like AZT (the first drug to treat HIV/AIDS), Taxol (the best-selling cancer drug in history), and the blockbuster allergy drug Claritin, Dr. Angell demonstrates exactly how new products are brought to market. Drug companies, she shows, routinely rely on publicly funded institutions for their basic research; they rig clinical trials to make their products look better than they are; and they use their legions of lawyers to stretch out government-granted exclusive marketing rights for years. They also flood the market with copycat drugs that cost a lot more than the drugs they mimic but are no more effective.The American pharmaceutical industry needs to be saved, mainly from itself, and Dr. Angell proposes a program of vital reforms, which includes restoring impartiality to clinical research and severing the ties between drug companies and medical education. Written with fierce passion and substantiated with in-depth research, The Truth About the Drug Companies is a searing indictment of an industry that has spun out of control.},

  abstract = {Introduction The dementia experience is not a monolithic phenomenon---and while core elements of dementia are considered universal---people living with dementia experience the disorder differently. Understanding the patterning of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the population with regards to incidence, risk factors, impacts on dementia care, and economic costs associated with ADRD can provide clues to target risk and protective factors for all populations as well as addressing health disparities. Methods We discuss information presented at the 2020 National Research Summit on Care, Services, and Supports for Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers, Theme 1: Impact of Dementia. In this article, we describe select population trends, care interventions, and economic impacts, health disparities and implications for future research from the perspective of our diverse panel comprised of academic stakeholders, and persons living with dementia, and care partners. Results Dementia incidence is decreasing yet the advances in population health are uneven. Studies examining the educational, geographic and race/ethnic distribution of ADRD have identified clear disparities. Disparities in health and healthcare may be amplified by significant gaps in the evidence base for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The economic costs for persons living with dementia and the value of family care partners' time are high, and may persist into future generations. Conclusions Significant research gaps remain. Ensuring that ADRD healthcare services and long-term care services and supports are accessible, affordable, and effective for all segments of our population is essential for health equity. Policy-level interventions are in short supply to redress broad unmet needs and systemic sources of disparities. Whole of society challenges demand research producing whole of society solutions. The urgency, complexity, and scale merit a ``whole of government'' approach involving collaboration across numerous federal agencies.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study analyzing data from 546 students aged 11-18 years, from fourteen randomly selected schools. Z-scores for WC and BMI were calculated. METHODS: The physical activity module of the Global School Health Survey 2007 was used to determine EME, and the shuttle run test was used to assess CRF. Linear regression models adjusted by age, school location, physical activity level, type of institution (public or private), consumption of sweetened beverages, fast food, and fried food were used. RESULTS: Among boys, independently of cardiorespiratory fitness, high television viewing time ({$\geq$} 2 h/day) ({$\beta$}=+0.22; p{$<$}0.02), was positively associated with waist circumference. High total screen time ({$>$}3h/day) was positively associated with waist circumference ({$\beta$}=+0.34; p{$<$}0.01), and body mass index ({$\beta$}=+0.39; p{$<$}0.01). Among girls, sedentary behavior was not associated with adiposity, but cardiorespiratory fitness ({$\beta$}=-0.04; p{$<$}0.02) was negatively associated with body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the evidence on the negative impact of excessive electronic media exposure and low cardiorespiratory fitness, and highlight the need for interventions and prevention strategies.},

The discussion is illustrated by empirical data gathered as part of an on-going study into Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI), a condition currently disputed within medical circles. Whilst there is empirical substantiation for some of Fleck's beliefs, the findings suggest his notion that general practitioners are educated and patients uneducated is too simplistic; in particular circumstances these attributes may be reversed. Furthermore, there is little evidence to show that ideas are circulated and exchanged between specialists, GPs and a lay audience; according to this revised view, medical knowledge is determined by experts alone. By invoking an extended version of Collins' notion of the `core-set', the paper considers how seemingly marginal actors can exploit their technical competence and thus play an influential role in medical debate.},

Methods: A scoping systematic review was performed using 5 search engines. Studies were included if they utilized virtual support groups for informal caregivers of persons with dementia. Study details, support group characteristics, outcomes, barriers, facilitators, and recommended approaches were extracted and summarized. Results: Of 1052 identified articles, 87 were retrieved; 62 were excluded largely because they described other virtual interventions. Groups typically used teleconferences or internet-based videoconferences, included 4 to 6 participants, lasted 60 minutes, and occurred weekly or monthly. Moderators were professionals; moderator training was common. Content focused on support, education, or both. Covered topics included dementia knowledge, caregiving skills, coping, and resources. Costs related to technology, programming, and staffing. Although most studies identified no statistical differences, caregivers described many participation benefits. Common barriers were technology and access. Facilitators included training, technology support, small groups, and skilled leaders. Conclusions: Clinics desiring to start virtual support groups should consider videoconferencing or telephone approaches with pretraining, technology support, and professional moderators. Clinics need adequate resources, particularly for technology, and identification of locally relevant goals and approach.},

It is suggested that, notwithstanding earlier commentary and criticism, and despite the sophistication of authors such as Mishler, too many narrative-based studies fall far short of a thoroughly analytic approach to such spoken actions. Too often narratives are celebrated as the means for analysts to gain access to personal experience, to the subjective or private aspects of illness. It is argued that we still need analytic strategies that treat illness (or any) narratives as speech acts, based on socially shared resources.},

Method: One hundred and thirty-four caregivers were interviewed. Path analyses were conducted using a self-efficacy scale that consists of three subscales assessing three domains of caregiving self-efficacy. Self-efficacy for obtaining respite, responding to disruptive patient behaviours, and controlling upsetting thoughts about caregiving were measured. Results: Results showed that self-efficacy acted as a partial mediator between social support and depressive symptoms of these caregivers. Conclusion: Findings suggest that self-efficacy may function as a mechanism through which social support influences depressive symptoms, and the importance of this self-efficacy mechanism can be domain-specific.},

  abstract = {Background and study goal: Social media are a societal phenomenon today, including the oldest generation, yet they are seldom used in current health research to identify the needs of persons with Alzheimer's disease (PADs) and their carers. There is an even bigger research gap in the analysis of caregivers' communication in online support groups and its classification according to activities of daily living (ADLs). For this, the goal of this study is to identify real-life practices of informal caregivers who care for PADs based on the analysis of their communication in Facebook groups. Methods: A sample of 1603 contributions was obtained from support groups by keyword search, manual coding, and verification; thus, the contributions in the sample are relevant for the individual basic ADLs of PADs. Next, five main conversation topics were identified for each ADL. This was done using the topic extractor based on simple parallel threaded implementation of LDA with a sparse sampling scheme and data structure. Results: The qualitative dimension of research identified discussion topics as well as specific caregiver behavior patterns for each ADL. The quantitative dimension determining the level of engagement of group members in individual ADLs was also measured. The highest engagement was found in activities of feeding and drinking, followed by bathing. In contrast, the activities of dressing, continence, and toileting attract the lowest interest. Moreover, the causal links between the topics discussed within the areas of ADLs were identified. Conclusions: The acquired knowledge can help further research focus on the most problematic areas relevant for people with AD in order to increase their quality of life and at the same time reduce the caregiver burden. The study expands the information of the demands posed by the individual caregiver activities, specifically in the context of activity-based costing or time-based activity costing.},

Based on a literature analysis centered on the information file on Alzheimer's disease published by INSERM and on scientific articles and communications addressing the etiology of the disease, this paper aims to show how the entity ``Alzheimer's disease'' is constructed today. After examining the way the figures on the disease have been produced, it will show how the etiology is constituted by advances in ``diagnostic techniques'' and research protocols.},

  abstract = {Based on ethnographic fieldwork in a nursing home in northern Denmark, this article addresses challenges experienced in putting formal ethics requirements into practice. We consider how to unite procedural ethics with actual, lived ethics, when researching with vulnerable participants who live with a cognitively impairing con\- dition. The article centers on the story of one resident, who wanted to share her experiences with what she had perceived as inadequate care, but who baulked once the wordy consent form was produced. The resident panicked that her words could now be used against her, that talking with the researcher would (further) compromise her care. She was caught in a bind, on the one hand she had a deep desire to tell her story, on the other the piece of paper in her hand threatened to trigger her anxiety and depression. In this article we therefore approach the consent form as an agent. By mapping out these unintended consequences of the consent form, we wish to draw attention to the complexities of ethical research conduct in practice, ultimately arguing that the concept of appropriate informed consent should be broadened so that it is sensitive to the lifeworld of participants.},

The anthropology of caregiving provides an understanding of the range of behaviors, perceptions, and feelings associated with providing care for another person. Culture, a concept central to anthropology, comprises the implicit and explicit set of assumptions, behavioral guidelines, and interconnected beliefs that are shared by members of a society (Helman, Culture, health and illness, 2001). Culture shapes both the experience of illness and that of giving care, and informs the ways that these roles are perceived by others. Illness behaviors are often linked to social factors, gender norms, ethnic factors, and politics, as well as differences in philosophies, cultures, and in socioeconomic status (Brown and Barrett Understanding and applying medical anthropology, 2009). This chapter will explore fundamental concepts from medical anthropology and describe their contributions to our understanding of caregiving.},

It disrupts taken-for-granted routines and biographical expectations among sufferers and spousal caregivers alike. Biographical disruption and biographical work are guiding frameworks among researchers studying the experiences of people with chronic illness. Time is a fundamental component of biographical trajectories, but little research explicitly engages George Herbert Mead's nonlinear theory of time to make sense of biographies. Using qualitative interviews with eight caregivers and participant observation with a Parkinson's support group, this paper shows how Mead's conception of time allows for a fluid, processual understanding of biography. My research suggests that caregivers do biographical and time work when a spouse is ill. They reinterpret the past, present, and future to sustain biographical continuity and a meaningful sense of self and other.},

Sections cover: The standard university-course specifications of contemporary writing, offering an extensive picture of the social, economic, and cultural contexts of these literary genres The impact and status of non-literary writing, and how this compares with certain literary genres as an index to contemporary culture and a reflection of the state of the publishing industry The practicalities and conventions of the publishing industry Contextual aspects of literary culture and the book industry, visiting the broader spheres of publishing, promotion, bookselling and literary culture Carefully linked chapters allow readers to tie key elements of the publishing industry to the particular demands and features of contemporary literary genres and writing, offering a detailed guide to the ways in which the three core areas of culture, economics and pragmatics intersect in the world of publishing. Further to being a valuable resource for those studying English or Creative Writing, the volume is a key text for degrees in which Publishing is a component, and is relevant to those aspects of Media Studies that look at interactions between the media and literature/publishing"--},

It made visible regularities that were invisible at the individual level, further supporting the classificatory approach of insurance and the assumption that all members of a class are identical risks. The second part focuses on the reversal of perspective currently occurring in data analysis with predictive analytics, and how this conceptually contradicts the collective basis of insurance. The tremendous volume of data and the personalization promise through accurate individual prediction indeed deeply shakes the homogeneity hypothesis behind pooling. The third part attempts to assess the extent of this shift in motor insurance. Onboard devices that collect continuous driving behavioural data could import this new paradigm into these products. An examination of the current state of research on models with telematics data shows however that the epistemological leap, for now, has not happened.},

  abstract = {Background: In the United States, over 15 million informal caregivers provide unpaid care to people with Alzheimer disease (AD). Compared with others in their age group, AD caregivers have higher rates of stress, and medical and psychiatric illnesses. Psychosocial interventions improve the health of caregivers. However, constraints of time, distance, and availability inhibit the use of these services. Newer online technologies, such as social media, online groups, friendsourcing, and crowdsourcing, present alternative methods of delivering support. However, limited work has been done in this area with caregivers. Objective: The primary aims of this study were to determine (1) the feasibility of innovating peer support group work delivered through social media with friendsourcing, (2) whether the intervention provides an acceptable method for AD caregivers to obtain support, and (3) whether caregiver outcomes were affected by the intervention. A Facebook app provided support to AD caregivers through collecting friendsourced answers to caregiver questions from participants' social networks. The study's secondary aim was to descriptively compare friendsourced answers versus crowdsourced answers. Methods: We recruited AD caregivers online to participate in a 6-week-long asynchronous, online, closed group on Facebook, where caregivers received support through moderator prompts, group member interactions, and friendsourced answers to caregiver questions. We surveyed and interviewed participants before and after the online group to assess their needs, views on technology, and experience with the intervention. Caregiver questions were pushed automatically to the participants' Facebook News Feed, allowing participants' Facebook friends to see and post answers to the caregiver questions (Friendsourced answers). Of these caregiver questions, 2 were pushed to crowdsource workers through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. We descriptively compared characteristics of these crowdsourced answers with the friendsourced answers. Results: In total, 6 AD caregivers completed the initial online survey and semistructured telephone interview. Of these, 4 AD caregivers agreed to participate in the online Facebook closed group activity portion of the study. Friendsourcing and crowdsourcing answers to caregiver questions had similar rates of acceptability as rated by content experts: 90\% (27/30) and 100\% (45/45), respectively. Rates of emotional support and informational support for both groups of answers appeared to trend with the type of support emphasized in the caregiver question (emotional vs informational support question). Friendsourced answers included more shared experiences (20/30, 67\%) than did crowdsourced answers (4/45, 9\%). Conclusions: We found an asynchronous, online, closed group on Facebook to be generally acceptable as a means to deliver support to caregivers of people with AD. This pilot is too small to make judgments on effectiveness; however, results trended toward an improvement in caregivers' self-efficacy, sense of support, and perceived stress, but these results were not statistically significant. Both friendsourced and crowdsourced answers may be an acceptable way to provide informational and emotional support to caregivers of people with AD.},

  abstract = {Globalization is a word that is currently much in use. This book is an attempt to show that there is far more to globalization than its surface manifestations. Unpacking the social roots and social consequences of globalizing processes, this book disperses some of the mist that surrounds the term. Alongside the emerging planetary dimensions of business, finance, trade and information flow, a localizing, space-fixing process is set in motion. What appears as globalization for some, means localization for many others; signalling new freedom for some, globalizing processes appear as uninvited and cruel fate for many others. Freedom to move, a scarce and unequally distributed commodity, quickly becomes the main stratifying factor of our times. Neo-tribal and fundamentalist tendencies are as legitimate offspring of globalization as the widely acclaimed hybridization of top culture - the culture at the globalized top. A particular reason to worry is the progressive breakdown in communication between the increasingly global and extra- territorial elites and ever more localized majority. The bulk of the population, the new middle class, bears the brunt of these problems, and suffers uncertainty, anxiety and fear as a result. This book is a major contribution to the unfolding debate about globalization, and as such will be of interest to students and professionals in sociology, human geography and cultural issues.},

Where policies do exist, they focus on relieving the burdens associated with caring or the needs of the person they care for, rather than consider the holistic needs of the caregiver that would enable them to flourish. We argue that the established approach to caregiver policies reflects a policy failure, requiring a reassessment of current practice related to caregiver support. Often, caregiver policies target the care recipient rather than the caregiver's needs. Through a consultative exercise, we identified five areas of need that existing caregiver policies touch upon. Yet current approaches remain piecemeal and inadequate in a global context. Caregiver policies should not just relieve burden to the extent that caregivers can continue in the role, but they should support caregivers to flourish, and future work may benefit from drawing on related frameworks from positive psychology, such as the PERMA™ model; this is important for both policymakers and researchers.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Caring for a sick or disabled relative has been linked to compromised caregiver health, and risk factors for negative caregiver outcomes have been studied extensively, but little attention has been given to care recipient and caregiver health as risk factors for potentially harmful behavior by informal caregivers. This article explores such risk factors. DESIGN: Structured interviews from baseline assessment of the Family Relationships in Late Life Study. SETTING: Three U.S. communities. PARTICIPANTS: Referred, volunteer sample of 265 caregiver/care recipient dyads. Caregivers were primarily responsible for care of an impaired, community-residing family member aged 60 and older and providing help with at least one activity of daily living (ADL) or two instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported care recipient demographics, cognitive status, need for care, and self-rated health; self-reported caregiver demographics, cognitive status, amount of care provided, self-rated health, physical symptoms, and depression. Care recipient reports of potentially harmful caregiver behavior, including screaming and yelling, insulting or swearing, threatening to send to a nursing home, and withholding food, were the main outcome variable. RESULTS: The following were significant risk factors for potentially harmful caregiver behavior: greater care recipient ADL/IADL needs (odds ratio (OR)=1.12, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.03-1.22), spouse caregivers (vs others; OR=8.00, 95\% CI=1.71-37.47), greater caregiver cognitive impairment (OR=1.20, 95\% CI=1.04-1.38), more caregiver physical symptoms (OR=1.07, 95\% CI=1.01-1.13), and caregivers at risk for clinical depression (OR=3.47, 95\% CI=1.58-7.62). CONCLUSION: Potentially harmful caregiver behavior is more likely in spouse caregiving situations and when care recipients have greater needs for care and caregivers are more cognitively impaired, have more physical symptoms, and are at risk for clinical depression. This risk profile is similar to that for negative caregiver outcomes.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Lay expertise---the knowledge accumulated through caregiving experiences---is essential for navigating healthcare systems, understanding Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), accessing support services, and managing emotional and physical challenges. This expertise enhances the quality of life for caregivers and care recipients, requiring caregivers to embody their roles and reassess their identities. This study explores how caregivers develop lay expertise, focusing on the impact of disruptive events and changing perspectives within their life course. Methods: Using a multi-sited design, this research integrates narrative analysis, ethnography, grounded theory, and situational analysis to examine the ecology of ADRD caregiving. Data were gathered through 20 in-depth interviews in English and Italian, and ethnographic fieldwork at Rete Magica in Forli, Italy, and LifeStream Services in Indiana, U.S. Results: Grounded theory analysis revealed two primary themes: *Building Lay Expertise*, encompassing caregivers' acquisition of knowledge and skills through lived experiences and emotional bonds, and *Constellation of Burdens*, detailing caregivers' multifaceted challenges and stressors. Additionally, concepts of biographical disruption and moments of discovery illustrate how crisis events reshape caregivers' identities and life trajectories. Situational analysis mapped relationships among caregivers, social actors, and cultural norms, highlighting the development of embodied knowledge and evolving self-identity as crucial for managing responsibilities and mitigating burden. Analysis: Interpreted through Andrew Abbott's processual sociology, findings depict caregiving as a dynamic, evolving process shaped by continuous adaptation and socio-cultural interactions, underscoring the importance of embodied knowledge and self-efficacy in reducing caregiver burden and promoting well-being. Discussion: This study advocates for enhanced support systems and policies that facilitate the development of lay expertise. With OECD populations aging rapidly, demand on informal caregivers will increase, necessitating support to mitigate social withdrawal and isolation. Findings highlight perceived social support as pivotal in shaping caregiving experiences and reducing burden across different settings, contributing to discourse on dementia caregiving by providing empirically grounded insights into caregivers' strategies and challenges.},

  abstract = {The recent proliferation of scholarship on collective action frames and framing processes in relation to social movements indicates that framing processes have come to be regarded, alongside resource mobilization and political opportunity processes, as a central dynamic in understanding the character and course of social movements. This review examines the analytic utility of the framing literature for understanding social movement dynamics. We first review how collective action frames have been conceptualized, including their characteristic and variable features. We then examine the literature related to framing dynamics and processes. Next we review the literature regarding various contextual factors that constrain and facilitate framing processes. We conclude with an elaboration of the consequences of framing processes for other movement processes and outcomes. We seek throughout to provide clarification of the linkages between framing concepts/processes and other conceptual and theoretical formulations relevant to social movements, such as schemas and ideology.},

  abstract = {It is widely recognized that social relationships and affiliation have powerful effects on physical and mental health. When investigators write about the impact of social relationships on health, many terms are used loosely and interchangeably including social networks, social ties and social integration. The aim of this paper is to clarify these terms using a single framework. We discuss: (1) theoretical orientations from diverse disciplines which we believe are fundamental to advancing research in this area; (2) a set of definitions accompanied by major assessment tools; and (3) an overarching model which integrates multilevel phenomena. Theoretical orientations that we draw upon were developed by Durkheim whose work on social integration and suicide are seminal and John Bowlby, a psychiatrist who developed attachment theory in relation to child development and contemporary social network theorists. We present a conceptual model of how social networks impact health. We envision a cascading causal process beginning with the macro-social to psychobiological processes that are dynamically linked together to form the processes by which social integration effects health. We start by embedding social networks in a larger social and cultural context in which upstream forces are seen to condition network structure. Serious consideration of the larger macro-social context in which networks form and are sustained has been lacking in all but a small number of studies and is almost completely absent in studies of social network influences on health. We then move downstream to understand the influences network structure and function have on social and interpersonal behavior. We argue that networks operate at the behavioral level through four primary pathways: (1) provision of social support; (2) social influence; (3) on social engagement and attachment; and (4) access to resources and material goods.},

  abstract = {Elderly people are more severely affected by COVID-19. Nevertheless scarce information about specific prognostic scores for this population is available. The main objective was to compare the accuracy of recently developed COVID-19 prognostic scores to that of CURB-65, Charlson and PROFUND indices in a cohort of 272 elderly patients from four nursing homes, affected by COVID-19. Accuracy was measured by calibration (calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshov (H-L) test), and discriminative power (area under the receiver operation curve (AUC-ROC). Negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) were also obtained. Overall mortality rate was 22.4 \%. Only ACP and Shi et al. out of 10 specific COVID-19 indices could be assessed. All indices but CURB-65 showed a good calibration by H-L test, whilst PROFUND, ACP and CURB-65 showed best results in calibration curves. Only CURB-65 (AUC-ROC\,=\,0.81 [0.75--0.87])) and PROFUND (AUC-ROC\,=\,0.67 [0.6--0.75])) showed good discrimination power. The highest NPV was obtained by CURB-65 (95 \% [90--98\%]), PROFUND (93 \% [77--98\%]), and their combination (100 \% [82--100\%]); whereas CURB-65 (74 \% [51--88\%]), and its combination with PROFUND (80 \% [50--94\%]) showed highest PPV. PROFUND and CURB-65 indices showed the highest accuracy in predicting death-risk of elderly patients affected by COVID-19, whereas Charlson and recent developed COVID-19 specific tools lacked it, or were not available to assess. A comprehensive clinical stratification on two-level basis (basal death risk due to chronic conditions by PROFUND index, plus current death risk due to COVID-19 by CURB-65), could be an appropriate approach.},

In order to access, the support service participants were provided with a computer and high speed Internet in their homes. Semi structured webcam-interviews were carried out with 31 family carers. A strategy for webcam interviewing was developed to ensure quality and create a comfortable interview situation for the family carers. Interviews were analysed using content analyses, resulting in the themes: Adopting new technology with help from others and Regaining social inclusion. The results indicate that ICT-based support can be valuable for older family carers in rural areas as it contributes to improve quality in daily life in a number of ways. In order to fully experience the benefits, family carers need to be frequent users of the provided support. Adequate training and encouragement from others were essential in motivating family carers to use the support service. Access to Internet and webcamera contributed to reducing loneliness and isolation, strengthening relationships with relatives living far away and enabled access to services no longer available in the area. Use of the ICT-service had a positive influence on the relationship between the older carer and adult grandchildren. It also contributed to carer competence and promote feelings of regaining independence and a societal role.},

  abstract = {Experiential knowledge' is increasingly recognised as an important influence on reproductive decisionmaking. `Experiential knowledge of disability' in particular is a significant resource within prenatal testing/screening contexts, enabling prospective parents to imagine and appraise future lives affected by disability. However, the concept of `experiential knowledge' has been widely critiqued for its idiosyncrasy, its impermanence and consequently its perceived inferiority to (medical) knowledge. This paper explores some of these key critiques of experiential knowledge through an analysis of its constitution and uses in the context of reproductive decision-making. Seventeen UK-resident women with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), or with SMA in their family, took part in two in-depth interviews: one in 2007 e9 and the other in 2013e4. By comparing and contrasting these women's accounts at two time points, this paper demonstrates the stark contrast between `lived experience' of SMA (the visceral everyday realities of life with the condition) and the various way(s) this experience was transformed into, and presented as, `knowledge' through the processes of making, and accounting, for reproductive decisions. The analysis highlights that multiple, distinct and sometimes competing experiential frameworks are used to conceptualise SMA across time and context. However, rather than evidence of its fallibility, this finding highlights that `knowledge' is an inappropriate vessel with which to capture and transfer `experiential knowledge'. Rather, we need to consider how to value such insight in ways that harnesses its inherent strength without leaving it vulnerable to the epistemological critiques attracted by labelling it `knowledge'.},

The second refers to a direct influence of the health of a patient on others' well-being, i.e., the effects of caring about other people. Using a sample of Dutch informal caregivers we found that both effects exist and may be comparable in size. Our results, while explorative, indicate that economic evaluations adopting a societal perspective should include both the family and the caregiving effects measured in the relevant individuals.},

Four kinds of factors were identified as delaying diagnosis, including the caregiver's lack of knowledge or reluctance to seek help, and patient, family, and physician-related factors. Of the 57 percent of survey respondents who reported a delay of at least 12 months between initial symptom recognition and diagnosis, 68 percent reported at least one factor related to their interaction with physicians.

  abstract = {Objective Because of the expected increase in the number of dementia patients, the unlikelihood of a cure in the near future, and the rising cost of care, there is an increasing need for effective caregiver interventions. Internet interventions hold considerable promise for meeting the educational and support needs of informal dementia caregivers at reduced costs. The current study aims to provide an overview of the evidence for the effectiveness, feasibility, and quality of Internet interventions for informal caregivers of people with dementia. Methods A systematic literature search of five scientific databases was performed, covering literature published up to 10 January 2013. Twelve studies were identified. The quality of the included studies was assessed according to the Cochrane level of evidence and the criteria list of the Cochrane Back Review Group. Results The intervention types, dosage, and duration differed widely, as did the methodological quality of the included studies. The overall level of evidence was low. However, the results demonstrate that Internet interventions for informal dementia caregivers can improve various aspects of caregiver well-being, for example, confidence, depression, and self-efficacy, provided they comprise multiple components and are tailored to the individual. Furthermore, caregivers could benefit from interaction with a coach and other caregivers. Conclusions Internet interventions for informal dementia caregivers may improve caregiver well-being. However, the available supporting evidence lacks methodological quality. More randomized controlled studies assessing interventions performed according to protocol are needed to give stronger statements about the effects of supportive Internet interventions and their most promising elements.

  abstract = {Ambiguous loss is a newly identified type of loss that occurs when a loved one is physically present, but psychologically absent. Dementia is just one example. Because the lost person is here, but not here, grief is frozen, life is put on hold, and people are traumatized. With no official verification of death, no possibility of closure, and no rituals for support, there is no resolution of grief (Boss 1999). Clergy, especially pastoral counselors, can witness and provide comfort for such uncanny loss because people rely on them for support, not just from the clear loss of death, but from the ambiguous losses, catastrophic and ordinary, that inevitably will occur across the life course.},

  abstract = {Outline of a Theory of Practice is recognized as a major theoretical text on the foundations of anthropology and sociology. Pierre Bourdieu, a distinguished French anthropologist, develops a theory of practice which is simultaneously a critique of the methods and postures of social science and a general account of how human action should be understood. With his central concept of the habitus, the principle which negotiates between objective structures and practices, Bourdieu is able to transcend the dichotomies which have shaped theoretical thinking about the social world. The author draws on his fieldwork in Kabylia (Algeria) to illustrate his theoretical propositions. With detailed study of matrimonial strategies and the role of rite and myth, he analyses the dialectical process of the 'incorporation of structures' and the objectification of habitus, whereby social formations tend to reproduce themselves. A rigorous consistent materialist approach lays the foundations for a theory of symbolic capital and, through analysis of the different modes of domination, a theory of symbolic power.},

  abstract = {Does money buy happiness, or does happiness come indirectly from the higher rank in society that money brings? We tested a rank-income hypothesis, according to which people gain utility from the ranked position of their income within a comparison group. The rank hypothesis contrasts with traditional reference-income hypotheses, which suggest that utility from income depends on comparison to a social reference-group norm. We found that the ranked position of an individual's income predicts general life satisfaction, whereas absolute income and reference income have no effect. Furthermore, individuals weight upward comparisons more heavily than downward comparisons. According to the rank hypothesis, income and utility are not directly linked: Increasing an individual's income will increase his or her utility only if ranked position also increases and will necessarily reduce the utility of others who will lose rank.},

Policy consideration of the relational nature of caregiving, the sociomaterial determinants of good care, the practical knowledge of caregivers and responsibilities of the state, is limited. Drawing on the ethics of care theory and a care ecology framework, which conceptualises the dynamic interactions between formal and informal care ``systems,'' we analysed ethnographic data of the interactions of 21 caregivers and their older care recipients in South Africa to understand how they conceptualised good care. Conceptualisations of good care included: having the right, altruistic and reciprocal, motivations; providing care frequently and consistently; and demonstrating hope for a better future through practical action. Caregivers also considered restricting autonomy a feature of good care, when doing so was perceived to be in the care recipient's best interest. Conceptualisations of good care were influenced by but also countered policy and cultural ideals. When they subverted policy values and practices, by overriding autonomy, for instance, caregivers' conceptualisations reflected their practical experiences of care\- giving amidst gross material inadequacies, underpinned by deficiencies in the formal care system. We highlight the need for policies, interventions and theories of care that focus broadly on the care ecology and particularly on the ``carescape'' (formal care system). We advocate relational approaches that consider and balance the needs, desires and rights of caregivers and care recipients, and recognise caregivers' experiential knowledge, rather than person-centred approaches that focus exclusively on the care recipient.},

We conducted a secondary analysis of qualitative data from caregivers of individuals who are minimally communicative, including persons with advanced dementia and individuals in disorders of consciousness. Our analysis led to two central claims: (1) Personhood is a threshold concept that is situated, relational, and dynamic and (2) in circumstances in which personhood is difficult to judge, caregivers can ``fill the gap'' to reach the threshold through a repertoire of strategies. Because personhood is in part an attribution from others, a situational loss of personhood does not preclude restoration, nor does it eliminate moral status. \copyright{} International Network on Feminist Approaches to Bioethics, 2023.},

Caregivers vulnerable to adverse effects can be identified, as can factors which ameliorate or exacerbate burden and strain. Psychosocial interventions have been demonstrated to reduce caregiver burden and depression and delay nursing home admission. Comprehensive management of the patient with dementia includes building a partnership between health professionals and family caregivers, referral to Alzheimer's Associations, and psychosocial interventions where indicated.},

It examines the Lockout from the perspective of social and gender history, focusing on communal eating which was a central feature of community survival and resistance. It documents the extensive network of soup kitchens for miners, which was established across the South Wales coal field during the seven months of the Lockout. In addition school feeding and the involvement of both central and local authorities is analysed. The article highlights the opportunities that arose from the Lockout, particularly through communal eating, for a reduction in gender segregation and a challenge to male dominance. It concludes that overall, women in these mining communities were concerned to maintain class solidarity with their men rather than to make advances for women. Maintaining the masculine identity of the militant miner, which necessarily incorporated male bonding and women's subordination, was regarded as an essential feature of the class struggle.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To document the integration of social science theory in literature on mHealth (mobile health) and consider opportunities for integration of classic theory, health communication theory, and social networking to generate a relevant theory for mHealth program design. METHOD: A secondary review of research syntheses and meta-analyses published between 2005 and 2014 related to mHealth, using the AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) methodology for assessment of the quality of each review. High-quality articles from those reviews using a randomized controlled design and integrating social science theory in program design, implementation, or evaluation were reviewed. Results There were 1,749 articles among the 170 reviews with a high AMSTAR score ({$\geq$}30). Only 13 were published from 2005 to 2014, used a randomized controlled design and made explicit mention of theory in any aspect of their mHealth program. All 13 included theoretical perspectives focused on psychological and/or psychosocial theories and constructs. Conclusions There is a very limited use of social science theory in mHealth despite demonstrated benefits in doing so. We propose an integrated theory of mHealth that incorporates classic theory, health communication theory, and social networking to guide development and evaluation of mHealth programs.},

  abstract = {Background An ageing global population will bring a significant increase in the prevalence of dementia, with the need for a collaborative international effort to combat this public health challenge being increasingly recognised. To be successful, this cooperation must be sensitive to the different cultural environments in which dementia is positioned, which shape the variety of clinical, political and social approaches to the condition worldwide. The aim of this project is to examine the social representations of dementia among people from three countries with different health care systems. More specifically, to investigate the internal structure of the social representations of dementia within the framework of the structural approach among British, American and Chinese lay-people. Methods A sample of 194 participants completed a free association task and a justification task in response to the stimulus word `dementia'. The data was subsequently analysed within the framework of the structural approach to social representations, using prototypical analysis. Results The American group's unique elements were nearly exclusively concerned with physical and cognitive decline, and elements referring to care were focused on external support, namely nursing homes. In the Chinese group, there were several elements referring to behaviour, but a much greater emphasis on cognition than predicted by the literature. Elements concerning care were, as expected, focused on the family. In the British group, there was also a cognitive focus, but this was accompanied by elements which portrayed the experience of the condition from the perspective of those affected, and a reference to relative well-being in the context of care. Conclusions Social representation theory proved to be a viable method in gathering data on cross-cultural differences in how dementia is understood and approached. The current study demonstrated how the conceptualisation of the condition's relationship with the cognitive, behavioural and affective dimensions might have an impact on the structure and form of care for those living with dementia in each culture.},

It is in the strategic interest of companies to take note of the production of culture from the bottom up for two reasons: to link user-driven innovation to their business and marketing processes (Car\`u and Cova 2007) and to bridge the gap between the meanings that companies assign to their brand and products and those actually produced by consumers (Walsh 2011).},

During the COVID-19 pandemic, securitised migration policies in Italy led to a severe health divide that exacerbated the already acute living conditions of many migrant communities. This article examines Italy's migration policy with a focus on the Security Decree and its consequences during the COVID-19 state-wide lockdown. Over the last decade, the surge in support for anti-immigration parties has fostered the portrayal of migrants as dangerous vectors of disease. In 2018, the Italian government approved the Security Decree which curtailed the already poor medical and sanitary conditions of the state's healthcare services provided to migrants and asylum seekers. This study outlines the characteristics of the Italian health divide during the COVID-19 outbreak and suggests a link between securitised migration policies and increased vulnerability of migrant communities during the pandemic.},

  abstract = {Summary~           The purpose of this study was to measure resource consumption associated with the provision of nonmedical care to noninstitutionalized patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) residing in the Lombardy Region of Italy. A questionnaire was mailed to 1,501 caregivers who sought advice from the ``Federation Alzheimer Italia'' in 1995. On the basis of 616 returned questionnaires, the authors estimated that a patient with AD requires 18 hours per week of paid nonmedical services and 45 hours per week of personal care provided by a primary caregiver. Primary caregivers are more likely to be women, spouses, and retired. Almost 7 of 10 patients are supported by at least a second caregiver. Annual expenditure for nonmedical cost per patient with AD is estimated to be L 13,388,000 (U.S. \$8,218). Using the replacement cost approach, the authors estimated the economic cost of informal (unpaid) care to be L 72,877,000 (U.S. \$44,736). Despite some limitations in the design of the survey, this first Italian study on primary data highlights the impressive economic burden of AD on families. It also shows that AD puts many Italian families at great financial risk. Adequate and timely funding arrangements should be urgently found to make resources available to future generations of patients.},

  abstract = {Caregivers provide support to persons who might otherwise require placement in long-term care facilities. Approximately one in five U.S. adults provides care to family members or friends who have a chronic health condition or disability. Promoting the well-being of this large segment of the population is a public health priority as recognized by the 2022 National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers. Although negative associations between caregiving and caregiver health are known, changes in the health status of caregivers over time are not. Data from the 2015--2016 and 2021--2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analyzed to compare changes in the prevalence of 19 health indicators among cross-sectional samples of caregivers and noncaregivers at different time points. Caregivers experienced improvements in prevalence of four health indicators, whereas six worsened. Some health indicators, such as cigarette smoking, improved for both caregivers and noncaregivers, although smoking prevalence remained higher for caregivers (16.6\% versus 11.7\%). Prevalence of lifetime depression increased for both groups and remained higher among caregivers (25.6\%) than among noncaregivers (18.6\%). During 2021--2022, ageadjusted estimates for caregivers were unfavorable for 13 of the 19 health indicators when compared with noncaregivers. Strategies for supporting caregivers are available, and integrating these with existing programs to address mental health and chronic diseases among this population might improve caregiver well-being. For example, many community organizations support caregivers by offering interventions designed to relieve caregiver strain, including skills training, support groups, and care coordination.},

  abstract = {Background: In today's technological society, children are exposed to electronic devices from an early age. During the Italian national lockdown from 8th March to 3rd May 2020 (56 days) in response to Covid-19, screen time increased significantly due to people's confinement at home and their consequent inability to physically interact with others. Virtual communication has provided some compensation to the problem of social distancing but at the same time, it has increased the amount of daily time both adults and children spend in sedentary activities, in contradiction to the daily movement and physical activity targets prescribed in the WHO guidelines. This preliminary research has investigated whether the highly sedentary lifestyle induced by theCovid-19 lockdown, combined with an increase in screen time, affected the sleep and Body Mass Index (BMI) of children aged 0-6 years. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire containing32 questions was sent by e-mail to parents of children aged 0-6 years. Where parents had more than one child, they were asked to fill in a form for each child. Results: Considering all the study subjects (n=125), there was no significant relationship between screen time and BMI in children aged 0-6 years (r=0.09) and between screen time and hours of sleep (r=-0.03). Conclusions: Despite the fact that during the period of health emergency the lockdown reduced the opportunities for movement and the physical activity prescribed by the WHO guidelines, no significant changes were found in the relationships between screen time and hours of sleep and between screen time and BMI. The high percentage of children with habits that conflict with those suggested by the WHO guidelines, both in terms of sleep and screen time, suggests that there is a need to increase parental awareness of the importance of the WHO health recommendations. It is important to attempt to subvert the constant demands of children to spend many hours sitting in front of a screen, by daily encouraging more dynamic play activities that involve greater expenditure of physical energy.},

  abstract = {The use of algorithmic prediction in insurance is regarded as the beginning of a new era, because it promises to personalise insurance policies and premiums on the basis of individual behaviour and level of risk. The core idea is that the price of the policy would no longer refer to the calculated uncertainty of a pool of policyholders, with the consequence that everyone would have to pay only for her real exposure to risk. For insurance, however, uncertainty is not only a problem -- shared uncertainty is a resource. The availability of individual risk information could undermine the principle of risk-pooling and risk-spreading on which insurance is based. The article examines this disruptive change first by exploring the possible consequences of the use of predictive algorithms to set insurance premiums. Will it endanger the principle of mutualisation of risks, producing new forms of discrimination and exclusion from coverage? In a second step, we analyse how the relationship between the insurer and the policyholder changes when the customer knows that the company has voluminous, and continuously updated, data about her real behaviour.},

  abstract = {Background: Social network sites (SNSs) are widely exploited in health education and communication by the general public, including patients with various conditions. Nevertheless, there is an absence of evidence evaluating SNSs in connecting health professionals for professional purposes. Objective: This pilot randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the feasibility of an intervention aiming to investigate the effects of a continuous professional education program utilizing Facebook to obtain knowledge on dementia and care for patients with dementia. Methods: Eighty health professionals from Hong Kong were recruited for participation in the study and randomized at a 1:1 ratio by a block randomization method to the intervention group (n=40) and control group (n=40). The intervention was an 8-week educational program developed to deliver updated knowledge on dementia care from a multidisciplinary perspective, either by Facebook (intervention group) or by email (control group) from October 2018 to January 2019. The primary outcomes were the effects of the intervention, measured by differences in the means of changes in pre- and postintervention scores of knowledge assessments from the 25-item Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS) and formative evaluation of 20 multiple choice questions. Other outcome measurements included participant compliance, participant engagement in Facebook, satisfaction, and self-perceived uses of Facebook for continuing professional education programs. Results: Significantly more intervention group participants (n=35) completed the study than the control group (n=25) (P\&lt;.001). The overall retention rate was 75\% (60/80). The mean of changes in scores in the intervention group were significant in all assessments (P\&lt;.001). A significant difference in the mean of changes in scores between the two groups was identified in the DKAS subscale Communication and Behavior (95\% CI 0.4-3.3, P=.02). There was no significant difference in the total DKAS scores, scores of other DKAS subscales, and multiple choice questions. Participant compliance was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P\&lt;.001). The mean numbers of participants accessing the learning materials were 31.5 (SD 3.9) and 17.6 (SD 5.2) in the intervention and control group, respectively. Polls attracted the highest level of participant engagement, followed by videos. Intervention group participants scored significantly higher in favoring the use of Facebook for the continuing education program (P=.03). Overall, participants were satisfied with the interventions (mean score 4 of a total of 5, SD 0.6). Conclusions: The significantly higher retention rate, together with the high levels of participant compliance and engagement, demonstrate that Facebook is a promising tool for professional education. Education delivered through Facebook was significantly more effective at improving participants' knowledge of how people with dementia communicate and behave. Participants demonstrated positive attitudes toward utilizing Facebook for professional learning. These findings provide evidence for the feasibility of using Facebook as an intervention delivery tool in a manner that can be rolled out into practical settings.},

  abstract = {Serious chronic illness undermines the unity between body and self and forces identity changes. To explicate how the body, identity, and self intersect in illness, one mode of living with impairment, adapting, is explicated in this article. Adapting means altering life and self to accommodate to bodily losses and limits and resolving the lost unity between body and self. It means struggling with rather than against illness. The process of adapting consists of three major stages: (1) experiencing and defining impairment, (2) making bodily assessments and, subsequently, identity trade-offs, as ill people weigh their losses and gains and revise their identity goals, and (3) surrendering to the sick self by relinquishing control over illness and by flowing with the experience of it. Adapting seldom occurs only once. Rather chronically ill people are forced to adapt repeatedly as they experience new losses. The data consist of 115 interviews about experiencing chronic illness and 25 more focused interviews about the body in chronic illness. The strategies of grounded theory provided the methods for completing the analysis.},

The grounded theory method is presented as a method having both phenomenoiogical and positivistic roots, which leads to confusion and misinterpretations of the method. A social constructionist version and application of grounded theory are introduced after brief overviews of the method and of the debates it has engendered are provided. Next, phases in developing concepts and theoretical frameworks through using the grounded theory approach are discussed. These phases include: (I) developing and refining the research and data collection questions, (2) raising terms to concepts. (3) asking more conceptual questions on a generic level and (4) making further discoveries and clarifying concepts through writing and rewriting. Throughout the discussion, examples and illustrations are derived from two recent papers, `Disclosing Illness' and `Struggling for a Self: Identity Levels of the Chronically III'. Last, the merits of the method for theoretical development are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dementia is an irreversible illness. The caregiver is expected to assume increased responsibility as the condition of the person with dementia declines. It is important to explore the factors constituting caregiver burden on the informal caregivers of people with dementia. AIMS: The purpose of this article is to identify the factors constituting caregiver burden on the informal caregivers of people with dementia living in the community. METHODS: A systematic review of the four databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library, was carried out to access relevant articles published between 2003 and 2012. Twenty-one articles met the inclusion criteria of this study. RESULTS: Behavioural problems or psychological symptoms were the primary factor of the person with dementia that is associated with caregiver burden. Caregiver socio-demographical factors and psychological factors were the two primary factors of the caregiver burden. LIMITATIONS: Several results of this study were based on studies that had their own limitations. Furthermore, the concept of caregiver 'burden' was not clearly defined in some of the studies; instead, the term was broadly defined. CONCLUSION: Factors of caregiver burden in regard to people with dementia living in the community were clarified in this review study. By identifying all of the factors, healthcare professionals can deliver appropriate assistance to relieve caregiver burden and improve the quality of caregiving for people with dementia. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: It is important to identify the factors of the burden on the caregivers of people with dementia living in the community to prevent early nursing home placement, deterioration of caregiver's health and reduce the adverse health outcomes for care recipients. A health-related policy should be formulated to help informal caregivers receive more professional assistance. Training opportunities should be provided for family caregivers to reduce the impact of caregiving on the delivery of effective care.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Caregivers of patients with early-onset dementia (EOD) experience high levels of burden, which is known to be affected by caregivers' psychological features as well as by patients' and caregivers' demographical and social variables. Although potential clinical, demographical, and social determinants have been separately examined, it is not known how they reciprocally interact. Methods: Ninety-two consecutive patient-caregiver dyads were recruited from the Cognitive Neurology Clinics of Modena, Northern Italy. Caregivers were asked to fill in questionnaires regarding their burden, psychological distress, and family economic status. Data were analyzed with multivariable regression models and then entered in a mediation model. Results: Caregiver burden was positively related to female caregiver sex, spousal relationship to the patient, severity of patient's behavioral symptoms, diagnostic delay, and financial distress of the family. It was negatively related to disease duration, patient's education, region of birth, caregiver age, number of caregiver's days off work, number of offspring, and caregiver perception of patient's quality of life. While the effect of caregiver age, diagnostic delay, and of proxies of family or social network directly impacted on caregiver's burden, the effect of patient's disease duration, being a wife caregiver, financial distress, and number of caregiver's days off work was entirely mediated by the level of caregiver psychological distress. Conclusions: Both direct actions (such as increasing social networks and shortening diagnostic delay) and indirect actions aimed at reducing psychological distress (such as increasing the number of caregiver's days off work and financial support) should be planned to reduce caregiver's burden.},

  abstract = {Background: There is consensus that dementia is the most burdensome disease for modern societies. Few cost-of-illness studies examined the complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) burden, considering at the same time health and social care, cash allowances, informal care, and out-of-pocket expenditure by families. Methods: This is a comprehensive cost-of-illness study based on the baseline data from a randomized controlled trial (UP-TECH) enrolling 438 patients with moderate AD and their primary caregiver living in the community. Results: The societal burden of AD, composed of public, patient, and informal care costs, was about \texteuro 20,000/yr. Out of this, the cost borne by the public sector was \texteuro 4,534/yr. The main driver of public cost was the national cash-for-care allowance (\texteuro 2,324/yr), followed by drug prescriptions (\texteuro 1,402/yr). Out-of-pocket expenditure predominantly concerned the cost of private care workers. The value of informal care peaked at \texteuro 13,590/yr. Socioeconomic factors do not influence AD public cost, but do affect the level of out-of-pocket expenditure. Conclusion: The burden of AD reflects the structure of Italian welfare. The families predominantly manage AD patients. The public expenditure is mostly for drugs and cash-for-care benefits. From a State perspective in the short term, the advantage of these care arrangements is clear, compared to the cost of residential care. However, if caregivers are not adequately supported, savings may be soon offset by higher risk of caregiver morbidity and mortality produced by high burden and stress. The study has been registered on the website www.clinicaltrials.org (Trial Registration number: NCT01700556).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Meta-analysis studies of specific types of support groups are limited. We conducted a review and assessment of the effectiveness of support groups for caregivers of demented patients, and examined the impact of support group characteristics. METHODS: A search of multiple, electronic databases including the Cochrane Library, Medline, PUBMED, and others was conducted; studies published between 1998 and 2009 were collected. Thirty quantitative journal articles that were true and quasi-experimental controlled trials on support groups for non-professional caregivers, including mutual support, psychoeducational, and educational groups were analyzed. Outcome indicators were psychological well-being, depression, burden, and social outcomes. RESULTS: Support groups showed a significant positive effect on caregivers' psychological well-being (Hedge's g\,=\,-0.44, 95\% CI\,=\,-0.73, -0.15), depression (Hedge's g\,=\,-0.40, 95\% CI\,=\,-0.72, -0.08), burden (Hedge's g\,=\,-0.23, 95\% CI\,=\,-0.33, -0.13), and social outcomes (Hedge's g\,=\,0.40, 95\% CI\,=\,0.09, 0.71). The use of theoretical models, and length and intensity of group sessions had a significant impact on the effect sizes for psychological well-being and depression. Ratio of female participation (for psychological well-being and depression) and average age (social outcomes) were significant predictor variables. CONCLUSIONS: Support groups benefit caregivers and findings of this meta-analysis serve as immediate guidance for group facilitators. Future research should include additional outcome variables with our defined factors on effectiveness collected as demographic characteristic data for comparison. A more comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of support groups is indicated to enhance outcomes for caregivers and patients.},

We searched MEDLINE and Web of Science for articles from the available database start year (1946 and 1891, respectively) to 6 November 2023 and manually reviewed reference lists of identified articles. Two investigators independently reviewed the abstracts and full-text articles to identify and summarize studies that analyzed the relationship between increasing temperature and crime, violence, or both and met a priori eligibility criteria. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used to extract information from included articles. Some study results were combined using a profile likelihood random-effects model for meta-analysis for a subset of outcomes: violent crime (assault, homicide), property crime (theft, burglary), and sexual crime (sexual assault, rape). This review is registered at PROSPERO, CRD42023417295.Results:We screened 16,634 studies with 83 meeting the inclusion criteria. Higher temperatures were significantly associated with crime, violence, or both. A 10{$^\circ$}C (18{$^\circ$}F) increase in short-term mean temperature exposure was associated with a 9\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 7\%, 12\%] increase in the risk of violent crime ({$I$}2=30.93\%; eight studies). Studies had differing definitions of crime and/or violence, exposure assessment methods, and confounder assessments.Discussion:Our findings summarize the evidence supporting the association between elevated temperatures, crime, and violence, particularly for violent crimes. Associations for some categories of crime and/or violence, such as property crimes, were inconsistent. Future research should employ larger spatial/temporal scales, consistent crime and violence definitions, advanced modeling strategies, and different populations and locations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP14300},

According to statistical data from the Taiwan Ministry of Education, the prevalence of obesity in school children from the southern part of the country is the highest in Taiwan. Thus, exploring the factors influencing BMI in elementary school children from southern Taiwan is crucial. This study investigated the influencing factors including physical activity levels, sedentary behaviors, dietary habits, and perceived body shape on the BMIs of elementary school children from southern Taiwan. A cross-sectional design was used, and the participants consisted of 3251 fifth-grade students (1628 boys, 50.1\%; 1623 girls, 49.9\%). The average BMI values for boys and girls were 19.69 and 18.70 (kg/cm) respectively. Statistically significant associations were observed between BMI and sex, 31-60 min of daily vigorous or moderate physical activities levels, length of time spent watching television, time spent on video games or the computer, and intake of vegetable or meat gravy with rice (p {$<$} 0.001). Perceived body shape also affected the BMI of school children. The results of this study enable educational institutions in Taiwan to understand the factors affecting the BMI of school children and use this information as the basis for future healthy body weight policies.},

Your colleague's husband's sister can make you fat, even if you do not know her. A happy neighbor has more impact on your happiness than a happy spouse. These startling revelations of how much we truly influence one another are revealed in the studies of the two authors (both have Phds), which have repeatedly made front-page news nationwide. Here they explain why emotions are contagious, how health behaviors spread, why the rich get richer, even how we find and choose our partners. The book shows that our world is governed by the Three Degrees of Influence Rule: we influence and are influenced by people up to three degress removed from us, most of whom we do not even know. The book overturns the notion of the individual and provides a revolutionary paradigm, that social networks influence our ideas, emotions, health, relationships, behavior, politics, and much more.

This demand is disproportionate if compared to the economic resources of health systems and is, therefore, heavily supported by the activity of the so-called ``informal caregivers''. With our article we propose to depict the current scenario in Italy, dwelling on the safeguards, to date, aimed at informal caregivers, which are insufficient to correct the criticalities associated with the burdensome assistance provided by such figures. Such critical issues result in a real risk for the health of informal caregivers and their loved ones and require urgent action by the health system. If it is true that health welfare is not able to protect the increasing number of people who are not self-sufficient, it is necessary to invest at least on specific measures to preserve the health and skills of those who are at the forefront of this hidden welfare.

  abstract = {Background: The perception of old age differs in different societies and cultures: in the Western societies, the loss of youth, multiple losses of functions and independence resulting in inability produce a social stigma. Dementia is common among the elderly, regardless of their ethnic background. In countries dominated by Western philosophical thought, the cognitive domain has been privileged over other mental domains. Knowledge of cultural factors is essential to an understanding of aging and dementia; studies are currently dominated by biomedical models that consider dementing disorders solely as a pathological entity caused by neuronal and neurotrasmitters loss, and focus on the individual without regard to sociocultural context. Aim: The purpose of this study is to explore how the phenomenon of dementia is perceived in ethnically diverse groups and cultures. Methods: Medline and Google Scholar searches were conducted for relevant articles, chapters and books published before 2014. Search terms used included anthropology, culture, ethnic elderly and dementia. Publications found through this indexed search were reviewed for further relevant references. Results: The experience of dementia is not universal, but is profoundly shaped by culture in which the demented person lives. Sociocultural conceptualization of the symptoms of dementing diseases remains obscure in many countries. Conclusion: Sociocultural conceptualization of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is of growing interest in shaping the interpretation of the symptoms of dementing diseases. To explore the intersection of culture with the expression of dementia may optimize the management of these complex and chronic conditions.},

Caregivers were more active than their age-sex peers in domestic and service activities, but less active in social activities. Caregivers' domestic activities increased with time since diagnosis, partly offsetting a corresponding decline for patients. Lifestyle activities predicted caregivers' use of respite services.

  abstract = {Background: End-of-life clinical experiences, particularly in pediatrics, are quite limited for pre-licensure nursing students. Though effective, end-of-life simulations can be costly, require facilitators trained in palliative and endof-life care, and are restricted by limited space and time availability. Such barriers prompt the question as to whether there is an effective alternative to simulation by which students can gain improved self-efficacy in therapeutic communication during pediatric end-of-life situations. Purpose: Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory and work exploring self-efficacy posits that vicarious learning pro\- vides learners opportunities to gain experience and knowledge through observation of peers in simulated set\- tings. This study evaluated the effectiveness of vicarious versus active learning on pre-licensure nursing students' perceived self-efficacy in providing therapeutic communication during a pediatric end-of-life situation. Method: Data were collected over three time points - pre-simulation, post-simulation, and post-debriefing - using a modified Self-Efficacy in Communication Scale. Results: Learners in both groups had significant improvement in self-efficacy across all time points. Only two items had significant differences between vicarious and active learner groups, but the effect was minor. Conclusion: Vicarious learning presents as a viable pedagogical approach for providing pre-licensure nursing students important learning opportunities related to pediatric end-of-life simulations during both the scenario and debriefing.},

It continues to inspire scholars and activists across the humanities, social sciences, and arts who are concerned with experimentation and ethics in cultural analysis.

  abstract = {Background: First generation migrants are reportedly at higher risk of mental ill-health compared to the settled population. This paper systematically reviews and synthesizes all reviews on the mental health of first generation migrants in order to appraise the risk factors for, and explain differences in, the mental health of this population. Methods: Scientific databases were searched for systematic reviews (inception-November 2015) which provided quantitative data on the mental ill-health of first generation migrants and associated risk factors. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full text papers for their suitability against pre-specified criteria, methodological quality was assessed. Results: One thousand eight hundred twenty articles were identified, eight met inclusion criteria, which were all moderate or low quality. Depression was mostly higher in first generation migrants in general, and in refugees/ asylum seekers when analysed separately. However, for both groups there was wide variation in prevalence rates, from 5 to 44 \% compared with prevalence rates of 8--12 \% in the general population. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder prevalence was higher for both first generation migrants in general and for refugees/asylum seekers compared with the settled majority. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder prevalence in first generation migrants in general and refugees/ asylum seekers ranged from 9 to 36 \% compared with reported prevalence rates of 1--2 \% in the general population. Few studies presented anxiety prevalence rates in first generation migrants and there was wide variation in those that did. Prevalence ranged from 4 to 40 \% compared with reported prevalence of 5 \% in the general population. Two reviews assessed the psychotic disorder risk, reporting this was two to three times more likely in adult first generation migrants. However, one review on the risk of schizophrenia in refugees reported similar prevalence rates (2 \%) to estimates of prevalence among the settled majority (3 \%). Risk factors for mental ill-health included low Gross National Product in the host country, downward social mobility, country of origin, and host country. Conclusion: First generation migrants may be at increased risk of mental illness and public health policy must account for this and influencing factors. High quality research in the area is urgently needed as is the use of culturally specific validated measurement tools for assessing migrant mental health.},

  abstract = {Here we propose the term `biographical dialectics' as a sister term to `biographical disruption' to capture the ongoing problem solving that characterises the lives of many people living with life limiting chronic illnesses. The paper is based on the experiences of 35 adults with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in receipt of haemo\- dialysis. Photovoice and semi-structured interviews showed that ESKD and the use of haemodialysis was widely agreed to be biographically disruptive. In talking about and showing disruption through photographs the par\- ticipants' ongoing problem solving was universal across their diverse experiences. `Biographical disruption' and Hegalian dialectical logic, are drawn on to make sense of these actions and to further understand the personal and disruptive experience of chronic illness. Based on this, `biographical dialectics' captures the work that is required to account for and manage the enduring and biographical impact of chronic illness that follows the initial disruption of diagnosis and continues as life progresses.},

Weber ([1922] 1978:85) defined formal rationality as the purposeful calculation of the most efficient means and procedures to realise goals. Formal rationality is the type of thinking and logical deduction that people use to determine what is most important in particular situations and the most effectual method they should use for reaching desired goals. Tradition, sentimentality, outmoded customs, piety and various other types of potentially less effective ways of doing things are discarded in favour of the most efficient action that can be calculated to achieve the ultimate outcome: what some call the `bottom line'.},

Drawing on more than a decade of ethnographic work, Lawrence Cohen links a detailed investigation of mind and body in old age in four neighborhoods of the Indian city of Varanasi (Banaras) with events and processes around India and around the world. This compelling exploration of senility---encompassing not only the aging body but also larger cultural anxieties---combines insights from medical anthropology, psychoanalysis, and postcolonial studies. Bridging literary genres as well as geographic spaces, Cohen responds to what he sees as the impoverishment of both North American and Indian gerontologies---the one mired in ambivalence toward demented old bodies, the other insistent on a dubious morality tale of modern families breaking up and abandoning their elderly. He shifts our attention irresistibly toward how old age comes to matter in the constitution of societies and their narratives of identity and history.},

The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 linked many HDHPs with tax-advantaged spending accounts. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act continues to provide for HDHPs in its lower-level plans on the health insurance marketplace and provides for them in employer-offered plans. HDHPs decrease the premium cost of insurance policies for purchasers and shift the risk of further payments to the individual subscriber. HDHPs reduce utilization and total medical costs, at least in the short term. Because HDHPs require out-of-pocket payment in the initial stages of care, primary care and other outpatient services as well as elective procedures are the services most affected, whereas higher-cost services in the health care system, incurred after the deductible is met, are unaffected. HDHPs promote adverse selection because healthier and wealthier patients tend to opt out of conventional plans in favor of HDHPs. Because the ill pay more than the healthy under HDHPs, families with children with special health care needs bear an increased cost burden in this model. HDHPs discourage use of nonpreventive primary care and thus are at odds with most recommendations for improving the organization of health care, which focus on strengthening primary care.This policy statement provides background information on HDHPs, discusses the implications for families and pediatric care providers, and suggests courses of action.}

A brief history of the diagnosis and treatment of hyperkinesis is presented, and social and clinical factors involved with this medicalization are discussed. Since the social control mechanism (stimulant drug treatment) was available 20 yrs before the medical label was described, the question of whether available social control leads to new medical labels was raised. The process of medicalization, often seen as humanitarian reform, has another side. Also considered are (a) the problem of expert controls, (b) medical social controls, (c) the individualization of social problems, and (d) the depoliticization of deviant behavior. Ramifications for the study of the sociology of deviance are presented. (31 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

However multiple forms of isolation are rarely studied together making it difficult to determine which aspects of isolation are most deleterious for health. Using population-based data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, we combine multiple indicators of social isolation into scales assessing social disconnectedness (e.g., small social network, infrequent participation in social activities) and perceived isolation (e.g., loneliness, perceived lack of social support). We examine the extent to which social disconnectedness and perceived isolation have distinct associations with physical and mental health among older adults. Results indicate that social disconnectedness and perceived isolation are independently associated with lower levels of self-rated physical health. However, the association between disconnectedness and mental health may operate through the strong relationship between perceived isolation and mental health. We conclude that health researchers need to consider social disconnectedness and perceived isolation simultaneously.},

The once accepted need for human presence in netnographic studies is giving way to nonparticipatory (passive) approaches, which claim to be naturalistic and bias-free. While this may be tenable in some environments, it also removes the opportunity for cocreation in online communities and social media spaces. By contrast, participatory (active) netnographers have an opportunity to conduct their research in a way that contributes value and a continuity of narrative to online spaces. This article examines the ways in which netnographies are being used and adapted across a spectrum of online involvement. It explores the ways in which netnographies conform to, or depart from, the unique set of analytic steps intended to provide qualitative rigor. It concludes by advocating for active netnography, one which requires a netnographic ``slog'' where researchers are prepared for the ``blood, sweat, and tears'' in order to reap rich benefits.},

Sufficient evidence exists to warrant a ban on junk-food or fast-food advertising in children's TV programming.

  abstract = {This article uses cross-sectional data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) database to test the effect of both long-term care (LTC) public benefits and insurance on the receipt of informal care provided by family members living outside the household in Italy and Spain. The choice of Italy and Spain comes from the fact that informal care is rather similar in these two countries while their respective public LTC financing systems are different. Our results support the hypothesis of LTC public support decreasing the receipt of informal care for Spain while reject it for Italy. They tend to confirm that the effect of public benefits on informal care depends on the typology of public coverage for LTC whereby access to proportional benefits negatively influences informal care receipt while access to cash benefits exerts a positive effect. Our results also suggest that private LTC insurance complements the public LTC financing system in place.},

  abstract = {Men in the United States suffer more severe chronic conditions, have higher death rates for all 15 leading causes of death, and die nearly 7 yr younger than women. Health-related beliefs and behaviours are important contributors to these differences. Men in the United States are more likely than women to adopt beliefs and behaviours that increase their risks, and are less likely to engage in behaviours that are linked with health and longevity. In an attempt to explain these differences, this paper proposes a relational theory of men's health from a social constructionist and feminist perspective. It suggests that health-related beliefs and behaviours, like other social practices that women and men engage in, are a means for demonstrating femininities and masculinities. In examining constructions of masculinity and health within a relational context, this theory proposes that health behaviours are used in daily interactions in the social structuring of gender and power. It further proposes that the social practices that undermine men's health are often signifiers of masculinity and instruments that men use in the negotiation of social power and status. This paper explores how factors such as ethnicity, economic status, educational level, sexual orientation and social context influence the kind of masculinity that men construct and contribute to differential health risks among men in the United States. It also examines how masculinity and health are constructed in relation to femininities and to institutional structures, such as the health care system. Finally, it explores how social and institutional structures help to sustain and reproduce men's health risks and the social construction of men as the stronger sex.},

  abstract = {International migration across Europe is increasing. High rates of net migration may be expected to increase pressure on healthcare services, including emergency services. However, the extent to which immigration creates additional pressure on emergency departments (EDs) is widely debated. This review synthesizes the evidence relating to international migrants' use of EDs in European Economic Area (EEA) countries as compared with that of non-migrants.MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library and The Web of Science were searched for the years 2000--16. Studies reporting on ED service utilization by international immigrants, as compared with non-migrants, were eligible for inclusion. Included studies were restricted to those conducted in EEA countries and English language publications only.Twenty-two articles (from six host countries) were included. Thirteen of 18 articles reported higher volume of ED service use by immigrants, or some immigrant sub-groups. Migrants were seen to be significantly more likely to present to the ED during unsocial hours and more likely than non-migrants to use the ED for low-acuity presentations. Differences in presenting conditions were seen in 4/7 articles; notably a higher rate of obstetric and gynaecology presentations among migrant women.The principal finding of this review is that migrants utilize the ED more, and differently, to the native populations in EEA countries. The higher use of the ED for low-acuity presentations and the use of the ED during unsocial hours suggest that barriers to primary healthcare may be driving the higher use of these emergency services although further research is needed.},

DESIGN: The meta-synthesis was conducted according to the principles of meta-ethnography. RESULTS: Fourteen studies describing the experiences of 265 informal caregivers were reviewed. The meta-synthesis elicited the following themes: (1) understanding and making sense of the dementia diagnosis, changing symptoms, and the caregiver role; (2) coping strategies, psychological facilitators and rewards of caregiver role; (3) challenges of caring for a person with dementia and their behaviour; (4) caregivers' relationships with care-recipient and other informal caregivers; and (5) caregivers' experiences of formal support services and material resources. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the need for a person-centred approach to care planning that also accounts for the needs of the informal caregiver to promote better caregiver well-being and quality of life. Caregivers' emotional support, coping, resilience, need for information and respite care and adjustment to caregiver identity should be reviewed as part of the care package for the person with dementia.},

  abstract = {In a qualitative framework, research based on interviews often seeks to penetrate social life beyond appearance and manifest meanings. This requires the researcher to be immersed in the research field, to establish continuing, fruitful relationships with respondents and through theoretical contemplation to address the research problem in depth. Therefore a small number of cases (less than 20, say) will facilitate the researcher's close association with the respondents, and enhance the validity of fine-grained, in-depth inquiry in naturalistic settings. Epistemologically prior to these considerations, however, is the explanatory status of such research. From a realist standpoint, here concept formation through induction and analysis aims to clarify the nature of some specific situations in the social world, to discover what features there are in them and to account, however partially, for those features being as they are. Since such a research project scrutinizes the dynamic qualities of a situation (rather than elucidating the proportionate relationships among its constituents), the issue of sample size - as well as representativeness - has little bearing on the project's basic logic. This article presents this argument in detail, with an example drawn from a study of persons with a past history of cancer diagnosis and treatment.},

Health systems face growing public pressure to collect data on patient ``social factors,'' and advocates and public officials seek to leverage such data sources as a means of system transformation. Despite the promise of this ``data-driven'' strategy, there is little empirical work that examines big data in action directly within the sites of care expected to transform. In this article, I present a case study on one such initiative, focusing on a large public safety-net health system's initiation of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection within the clinical setting. Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews with providers, staff, and administrators, I highlight three main challenges that elude big data's grasp on inequality: (1) provider and staff's limited understanding of the social significance of data collection; (2) patient perception of the cultural insensitivity of data items; and (3) clinic need to balance data requests with competing priorities within a constrained time window. These issues reflect structural challenges within safety-net care that big data alone are unable to address in advancing social justice. I discuss these findings by considering the present data-driven strategy alongside two complementary courses of action: diversifying the health professions workforce and clinical education reform. To truly advance justice, we need more than ``just data'': we need to confront the fundamental conditions of social inequality.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Social support interventions for caregivers of persons with dementia (PwD) are important because informal carers often rely on their social networks for support. This systematic review synthesises findings from research on social support interventions, and examines their methodological quality and effectiveness on caregiver social support and well-being variables. METHODS: A systematic literature search utilised five databases. Papers were selected when the primary aim of the intervention was to improve social support. Quality of papers was assessed by the Level of Evidence grade and the criteria list from the Cochrane Back Review Group. RESULTS: 39 papers were identified and classified into 4 social support intervention categories: befriending and peer support, family support and social network interventions, support groups, and remote interventions using the internet or telephone. Content, intensity, uptake, effectiveness and quality of interventions varied widely. In general, the level of evidence was low. Most studies measured effect on well-being variables, while few examined social support outcomes. Multi-component social support interventions were most effective. Evidence suggested, also a caregiver benefit from remote interventions. Generally, results were inconsistent; some papers demonstrated beneficial results, while others demonstrated no improvement on social support and well-being variables. Social support outcomes were more positively evaluated when qualitative outcome measures rather than quantitative measures were used. CONCLUSIONS: Although multi-component social support interventions may improve caregiver well-being, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether a change in social support is the underlying mediating factor. The inclusion, validation and operationalization of caregiver social support measures deserve more attention.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Social support interventions for caregivers of persons with dementia (PwD) are important because informal carers often rely on their social networks for support. This systematic review synthesises findings from research on social support interventions, and examines their methodological quality and effectiveness on caregiver social support and well-being variables. METHODS: A systematic literature search utilised five databases. Papers were selected when the primary aim of the intervention was to improve social support. Quality of papers was assessed by the Level of Evidence grade and the criteria list from the Cochrane Back Review Group. RESULTS: 39 papers were identified and classified into 4 social support intervention categories: befriending and peer support, family support and social network interventions, support groups, and remote interventions using the internet or telephone. Content, intensity, uptake, effectiveness and quality of interventions varied widely. In general, the level of evidence was low. Most studies measured effect on well-being variables, while few examined social support outcomes. Multi-component social support interventions were most effective. Evidence suggested, also a caregiver benefit from remote interventions. Generally, results were inconsistent; some papers demonstrated beneficial results, while others demonstrated no improvement on social support and well-being variables. Social support outcomes were more positively evaluated when qualitative outcome measures rather than quantitative measures were used. CONCLUSIONS: Although multi-component social support interventions may improve caregiver well-being, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether a change in social support is the underlying mediating factor. The inclusion, validation and operationalization of caregiver social support measures deserve more attention.},

  abstract = {Background Vietnam is facing rapid population ageing, with one in four Vietnamese citizens being over 60 years old by 2050. This has contributed to a boom of chronic and non-communicable diseases, such as dementia. In order to develop a national dementia plan as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and increase the preparedness of the healthcare system to tackle dementia, a situational analysis of the current healthcare services related to dementia is needed. Method In late 2019, we conducted a situational analysis desk review of the healthcare system in Vietnam, focusing on health service delivery for the elderly, using the guidance developed by the Strengthening Responses to Dementia In Developing Countries (STRiDE) project. The WHO's six-building-block framework was used to analyse the healthcare system in Vietnam, followed by the thematic and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analyses of dementia-related healthcare services. Result Although Vietnam has achieved significant improvement in healthcare in general, there are still inefficiencies in health service delivery. There are also discrepancies in health service readiness and quality across areas of healthcare. Despite of extensive primary healthcare system, grassroots-level facilities have inadequate infrastructure required for basic care delivery and none for dementia. There are few healthcare facilities at central and provincial levels, mainly located in the three biggest cities of Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh and Danang, providing services for people with dementia. There is limited training in dementia diagnosis and management for health professionals. Conclusion Developing a national dementia plan, including transforming the current healthcare services to better cope with rapid population ageing and dementia disease is urgently needed in Vietnam. Integrating dementia services into existing health and social services for the elderly and the disabled, making use of the extensive primary healthcare system in detection, early interventions, management and support for people with dementia at community level are strategic solutions to deal with dementia in a sustainable way. To this end, a whole-system approach in transformation and operation with implementing a patient centred care model is necessary.},

  abstract = {Intergenerational solidarity within families is the traditional source of support for dependent elderly people in southern European countries, where care needs have been mainly fulfilled by the unpaid work of women. Recently, the decline of informal care and the persistent lack of supply of formal services have been accompanied by the growth of commercial services mostly provided by migrant women hired by families in the grey market. The article is based on a qualitative study and explores the social processes underlying these changes. It suggests that although intergenerational solidarity is still crucial, it is expressed less through the direct provision of care and more through the supervision of paid services. This shift, which results mainly from a strategy adopted by middle-class women, challenges traditional gender relations and divisions of work. Moreover, it produces employment relations characterized by low pay and underprotection and reflecting conflicts over time and space typically present in informal care relations.},

The recent DSM-5, the manual of all diagnosable mental illnesses, for the first time included shyness and grief as treatable diseases. Happiness has become the biggest idea of our age, a new religion dedicated to well-being. In this brilliant dissection of our times, political economist William Davies shows how this philosophy, first pronounced by Jeremy Bentham in the 1780s, has dominated the political debates that have delivered neoliberalism. From a history of business strategies of how to get the best out of employees, to the increased level of surveillance measuring every aspect of our lives; from why experts prefer to measure the chemical in the brain than ask you how you are feeling, to why Freakonomics tells us less about the way people behave than expected, The Happiness Industry is an essential guide to the marketization of modern life. Davies shows that the science of happiness is less a science than an extension of hyper-capitalism.},

AIMS: To develop a user-friendly observer-rated dementia screening questionnaire with strong psychometric properties for adults with intellectual disabilities. METHOD: We used qualitative methods to gather information from carers of people with Down's syndrome about the symptoms of dementia. This provided the items for the Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID), which we then tested for its psychometric properties. RESULTS: The DSQIID was administered to carers of 193 adults with Down's syndrome, 117 of whom were examined by clinicians who confirmed a diagnosis of dementia for 49 according to modified ICD-10 criteria. We established that a total score of 20 provides maximum sensitivity (0.92) and optimum specificity (0.97) for screening. The DSQIID has sound internal consistency (alpha=0.91) for all its 53 items, and good test-retest and interrater reliability. We established a good construct validity by dividing the items into four factors. CONCLUSIONS: The DSQIID is a valid, reliable and user-friendly observer-rated questionnaire for screening for dementia among adults with Down's syndrome.},

  abstract = {Background Despite the generally accepted belief that social support improves caregiver adjustment in general and subjective burden in particular, the literature shows mixed findings, and a recent review concluded that the predictive strength of caregiver social support in determining caregiver burden is less evident, due to the conceptual diversity of this determinant. Objective The purpose of this review is to analyse the relationship of perceived and received social support with subjective burden among informal caregivers of an adult or older adult. Methods A systematic search was carried out up to September 2017 in the following databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO), Scopus and ISI Proceedings, and a meta-analysis was performed with the results of the selected and included studies. Results Fifty-six studies were included in the meta-analysis, which provided 46 independent comparisons for perceived support and 16 for received support. Most of these studies were cross-sectional. There was a moderate, negative association of perceived social support on subjective burden (r = -0.36; CI 95\% = -0.40, -0.32) and a very small, negative association of received support on subjective burden (r = -0.05; CI 95\% = -0.095, -0.001). Conclusions 1) perceived and received support are not redundant constructs, 2) the relationships between social support and subjective burden depend on whether the social support is measured as perceived or received, 3) the relationship of perceived social support with subjective burden has a bigger effect size than that of received social support, the relation between received support and subjective burden being clinically irrelevant, 4) perceived social support may be a good predictor of subjective burden. Implications of key findings Our findings broadly support interventions promoting social support in caregivers to prevent or alleviate subjective burden, and specifically, to intervene on the promotion of perceived social support more than on the promotion of received social support when preventing or alleviating burden.},

  abstract = {The present work aims to study the role of air pollutants in relation to the number of deaths per each Italian province affected by COVID-19. To do that, specific mortality from COVID-19 has been standardized for each Italian province and per age group (10 groups) ranging from 0 to 9 years to {$>$}90 years, based on the 2019 national population figures. The link between air pollutants and COVID-19 mortality among Italian provinces was studied implementing a linear regression model, whereas the wide set of variables were examined by means of LISA (Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation), relating the spatial component of COVID-19 related data with a mix of environmental variables as explanatory variables. As results, in some provinces, namely the Western Po Valley provinces, the SMR (Standardized Mortality Ratio) is much higher than expected, and the presence of PM10 was independently associated with the case status. Furthermore, the results for LISA on SMR and PM10 demonstrate clusters of high-high values in the wide Metropolitan area of Milan and the Po Valley area respectively, with a certain level of overlap of the two distributions in the area strictly considered Milan. In conclusion, this research appears to find elements to confirm the existence of a link between pollution and the risk of death due to the disease, in particular, considering land take and air pollution, this latter referred to particulate (PM10). For this reason, we can reiterate the need to act in favour of policies aimed at reducing pollutants in the atmosphere, by means of speeding up the already existing plans and policies, targeting all sources of atmospheric pollution: industries, home heating and traffic.},

The study uses the 2005 edition of the Italian National Health Survey to estimate the correlation between being an immigrant and the probability of accessing various health services (e.g., general practitioners, specialist doctors, hospitals, emergency departments, tests for blood cholesterol). Fitted regression models control for various individual characteristics, including socioeconomic conditions, demographics, need variables, and lifestyle habits, as well as for territorial characteristics. Immigrants, both first and second generation, are identified by crossing information on citizenship with information on birthplaces. The results show that foreigners and foreign-born people suffer from unequal access to health care services. They are more likely to contact emergency services and less likely to visit specialist doctors and use preventive care. Similar results appear for second-generation immigrants, who display a lower probability of visiting specialist doctors and higher hospitalization rates. Vast heterogeneity across areas of birth also is documented.},

  abstract = {This paper uses a novel dataset and research design to examine the effects of information networks on immigrants' access to health care. The dataset consists of an unusually large sample of undocumented immigrants and contains a direct indicator of information networks---whether an immigrant was referred to health care opportunities by a strong social tie (relative or friend). This measure allows to overcome some of the major identification issues that afflict most of the existing literature on network effects and to concentrate on one of the channels through which social contacts might operate. The analysis focuses on the time spent in Italy before an immigrant first receives medical assistance. Estimates indicate that networks significantly foster health care utilization: after controlling for all available individual characteristics and for ethnic heterogeneity, I find that relying on a strong social tie reduces the time to visit by 30\%. The effect of information networks is stable across specifications and it is relatively large. Further investigation seems to confirm the quantitative importance of networks as an information device.},

The review focuses on conceptual and theoretical approaches, sampling strategies, measurement techniques, and similarities and differences found among groups and across studies. Design and Methods: A narrative approach was used to review 59 articles published between 1980 and 2000, with particular attention to race, ethnicity, and/or culture. Primary sources of relevant articles included electronic databases, other review articles, and reference lists. Results: Caregiving experiences and outcomes varied across racial and ethnic groups. However, the use of nontheoretical approaches, nonprobability samples, and inconsistent measures among studies has limited understanding of caregiving among diverse populations. Implications: It is important that conceptualization and theorizing broaden with increasing numbers of studies that include diverse groups. Future caregiving research needs to give more attention to such issues as acculturation, assimilation, and cultural values, beliefs, and norms, while also improving theoretical and methodological rigor.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The health status and health care needs of immigrant populations must be assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate barriers to accessing primary care and the appropriateness of health care among resident immigrants in Italy, using indicators regarding maternal health, avoidable hospitalization, and emergency care. Methods: Cross-sectional study using some indicators of the National Monitoring System of Health Status and Healthcare of the Immigrant Population (MSHIP), coordinated by the National Institute for Health, Migration and Poverty (INMP), calculated on perinatal care, hospital discharge, and emergency department databases for the years 2016--2017 in nine Italian regions (Piedmont, Trento, Bolzano, Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Umbria, Latium, Basilicata, Sicily). The analyses were conducted comparing immigrant and Italian residents. Results: Compared to Italian women, immigrant women had fewer than five gynecological examinations (8.5 vs. 16.3\%), fewer first examinations after the 12th week of gestational age (3.8 vs. 12.5\%), and fewer than two ultrasounds (1.0 vs. 3.8\%). Compared to Italians, immigrants had higher standardized rates (\texttimes{} 1,000 residents) of avoidable hospitalizations (males: 2.1 vs. 1.4; females: 0.9 vs. 0.7) and of access to emergency departments for non-urgent conditions (males: 62.0 vs. 32.7; females: 52.9 vs. 31.4). Conclusions: In Italy, there appear to be major issues regarding accessing services and care for the immigrant population. Policies aimed at improving socioeconomic conditions and promoting integration can promote healthy lifestyles and appropriate access to health care, counteracting the emergence of health inequities in the immigrant population.},

  abstract = {Background: The world is facing many socio-demographic changes, such as an increased average life expectancy and the presence of chronic and non-communicable diseases, which in turn, leads to an enhanced dependency on others. Consequently, the demand for informal caregivers has significantly increased during the past few years. Caring for a dependent person is linked to a series of burdens that often leads to physical, psychological and emotional difficulties. Taking into consideration the difficulties faced by informal caregivers, knowing in which areas of functioning they need more guidance may help to relieve their burden. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to better understand the needs and competencies of the informal caregiver when caring for a dependent person in the different self-care domains. Methods: This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire administered on a single occasion by face-to-face interview. Descriptive and inferential statistics alongside non-parametric statistical techniques such as the MannWhitney test and Spearman's correlation were used. Results: The average age of the 143 informal caregivers is 58 years old, with the youngest in our sample being 21 years of age. Most of them are female, and 50\% of them are children taking care of one of their parents. Most of the dependent people are completely dependent in the areas of comfort and hygiene (53.8\%) and medication management (55.9\%). The female informal caregivers see themselves as having more competencies in sanitary hygiene than the male ones, with no significant differences in their competencies' perception in the other areas of self-care. Older caregivers see themselves as less competent in certain areas of self-care such as feeding, mobility, transfers, medication and symptoms management and communication. Most of the information given to the informal caregiver is about the disease (82.3\%) and the medication management (80.4\%). There are still a lot of areas of self-care, where no information, or almost none, is given to the informal caregivers. Conclusions: Before home discharge of a dependent person, it is important to acknowledge the needs and competencies of the informal caregiver, to capacitate them in looking after their relatives, to help decrease their burden and consequently, decrease the number of hospital readmissions.},

  abstract = {Wellbeing is a growing area of research, yet the question of how it should be defined remains unanswered. This multi-disciplinary review explores past attempts to define wellbeing and provides an overview of the main theoretical perspectives, from the work of Aristotle to the present day. The article argues that many attempts at expressing its nature have focused purely on dimensions of wellbeing, rather than on definition. Among these theoretical perspectives, we highlight the pertinence of dynamic equilibrium theory of wellbeing (Headey \& Wearing, 1989), the effect of life challenges on homeostasis (Cummins, 2010) and the lifespan model of development (Hendry \& Kloep, 2002). Consequently, we conclude that it would be appropriate for a new definition of wellbeing to centre on a state of equilibrium or balance that can be affected by life events or challenges. The article closes by proposing this new definition, which we believe to be simple, universal in application, optimistic and a basis for measurement. This definition conveys the multi-faceted nature of wellbeing and can help individuals and policy makers move forward in their understanding of this popular term.},

But the book's classism has not yet aroused such dismay. This essay argues that the antiracism of its main character---an adult Jean Louise Finch---is articulated in part by snobbish opposition to what she deems to be ``white trash'' attitudes. In this way Lee's critique of a steeply stratified southern society is compromised by her transferring the symbolic rhetoric of defilement from a racial ``other'' to a class ``other'' assumed to be racist. Studying the classist premise of Watchman, then, helps attune us to its operation in To Kill a Mockingbird.},

Type 1 disease has no neurological involvement and is treatable with enzyme replacement therapy. Type 2 disease results in infant death and type 3 disease is a heterogenous disorder characterised by progressive neurological decline throughout childhood and adult life. Endeavours to find a therapy to modify neurological disease are limited by a lack of meaningful clinical outcome measures which are acceptable to patients. Results: We present results from a pilot study utilising wearable technology to monitor physical activity as a surrogate of disease activity/severity paired with a mobile phone app allowing patients to complete self-reported outcome measures in the real world as opposed to the hospital environment. We demonstrate feasibility of the approach and highlight areas for development with this study of 21 patients, both children and adults. Conclusions: We illustrate, where patients engage in the methodology, a rich dataset is obtainable and useful for proactive clinical care and for clinical trial outcome development.},

  abstract = {Background: It is estimated that more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD), and the population of people living with the disease is expected to triple by 2060. Most care for persons living with ADRD is provided by informal caregivers. However, current strategies to improve the quality of life for both people living with ADRD and their informal caregivers are not optimal, especially from a comprehensive approach. Social media and online forums have become increasingly popular tools for ADRD caregivers to manage the burden of caregiving. Objective: This study was to: 1) explore informal caregivers' discussion topics by analyzing the caregiver online forum data, and 2) develop a comprehensive model based on their discussion topics, with the aim to improve quality of life for both persons living with ADRD and their informal caregivers. Methods: Publicly available peer interactions of 4102 registered users, with 96\% self-claimed as informal caregivers (67\% as a child of a person with dementia, 13\% as a partner/spouse , and 7\% as a relative ) on the Alzheimer's Association ALZ Connected Caregivers Forum were extracted in January 2019 using computer programming. A total of 40,798 postings were collected. All authors agreed to use a triangular model to serve as the predetermined three major themes to categorize all codes. The three major themes were: Factors of Caregivers, Factors of Individuals with ADRD, and Factors of Care Context. Inductive coding was used to derive in vivo codes from the data and the codes were further refined throughout the coding process. Two researchers independently coded postings until saturation was reached. Discrepancies were discussed among the two researchers to reach consensus. A third senior researcher's opinion was referred to whenever necessary. Results: For Factors of Caregivers, the most frequent sub-themes were perceived caregiver burden, caregiver's life balance, caregiving strategies, communication, expectations, personal health issues, poor relationship, and ineffective coping. Sub-themes of Factors of Individuals with ADRD included changes in abilities and capacities, commodities, behaviors, health conditions, daily living function, disengagement, and ineffective coping. Lastly, for Factors of Care Context, the most frequent sub-themes were family support, financial support, informational support, professional support, length of care provided, living arrangement, activities and stimulation, patient health care coordination, unexpected situations, communication, and physical environment. One sub-theme under one of the triangular factors may influence another sub-theme under another triangular factor, and vice versa. Conclusions: By analyzing the discussions of informal caregivers on ALZ online forum, we found that taking care of a loved one with ADRD is challenging for informal caregivers, the challenges may affect the quality of life for both caregivers and the caregiver recipients; factors of care recipients, caregivers, and the care context interactively affect perceived challenges of caregivers. This study has identified a comprehensive model, which may be used to help improve quality of life for both informal caregivers and people living with ADRD. Our next step is to use these manually determined codes to analyze all extracted postings via machine learning to improve this model.},

Although caregiving is associated with significant psychological and physical morbidity, there are wide individual differences among caregivers in how well they adapt to caregiving demands. In addition, recent data suggest that caregiver variables can be important determinants of AD patient institutionalization and that AD patients living with highly distressed caregivers may exhibit higher frequencies of behavioral problems and agitation than those living with less distressed caregivers. Predictors of caregiver outcome, predictors of institutionalization, and the effect of the caregiver on the course and symptomatology of dementia are described. A model of assessment and intervention for the physician, referral processes, and resources for the caregiver are presented.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of television viewing time with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-h postchallenge plasma glucose (2-h PG) levels in Australian adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 8,357 adults aged {$>$} 35 years who were free from diagnosed diabetes and who attended a population-based cross-sectional study (Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study [AusDiab]) were evaluated. Measures of FPG and 2-h PG were obtained from an oral glucose tolerance test. Self-reported television viewing time (in the previous week) was assessed using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-\%S) and beta-cell function (HOMA-\%B) were calculated based on fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders and physical activity time, time spent watching television in women was positively associated with 2-h PG, log fasting insulin, and log HOMA-\%B and inversely associated with log HOMA-\%S (P {$<$} 0.05) but not with FPG. No significant associations were observed with glycemic measures in men. The beta-coefficients across categories of average hours spent watching television per day ({$<$} 1.0, 1.0-1.9, 2.0-2.9, 3.0-3.9, and {$>$} or = 4.0) for 2-h PG in women were 0 (reference), 0.009, 0.047, 0.473, and 0.501, respectively (P for trend = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the unique deleterious relationship of sedentary behavior (indicated by television viewing time) and glycemic measures independent of physical activity time and adiposity status. These relationships differed according to sex and type of glucose measurement, with the 2-h PG measure being more strongly associated with television viewing. The findings suggest an important role for reducing sedentary behavior in the prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, especially in women.},

  abstract = {Background: Given the dramatic projected increase in Alzheimer's disease globally and the increased risk of morbidity and mortality for family caregivers of these patients, there is an urgent need to provide more targeted, timely resources to support the health and well-being of these informal caregivers. Few studies have investigated the barriers to health and well-being and potential strategies to facilitate better self-care from the unique perspective of the caregivers themselves. Purpose: This qualitative study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to health and well-being for informal caregivers of family members with Alzheimer's. Method: We conducted semi-structured interviews with eight informal caregivers, including daughters, wives, and one husband, ages 32 to 83. Using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, we identified three main themes and subthemes across caregivers' experiences. Findings: We found that caregivers (1) prioritized mental and social well-being over physical health or health behaviors; (2) characterized the subjective burden of caregiving as a ``mantle of responsibility'' that could not easily be shed due to the complex subjective burden of loss, grief, guilt, resentment, isolation, loneliness, and lack of agency; (3) sought to be recognized as ``additional patients'', instead of being viewed as invisible patients, with support services tailored to their life stage and challenges. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the subjective burden of strain experienced by family caregivers of Alzheimer's patients has a profound impact on their health and well-being, even more so than the objective burden of strain that is the result of their day-to-day caregiving activities.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the association of income and happiness. The basic data consist of statements by individuals on their subjective happiness, as reported in thirty surveys from 1946 through 1970, covering nineteen countries, including eleven in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Within countries, there is a noticeable positive association between income and happiness---in every single survey, those in the highest status group were happier, on the average, than those in the lowest status group. However, whether any such positive association exists among countries at a given time is uncertain. Certainly, the happiness differences between rich and poor countries that one might expect on the basis of the within-country differences by economic status are not borne out by the international data. Similarly, in the one national time series studied, for the United States since 1946, higher income was not systematically accompanied by greater happiness. As for why national comparisons among countries and over time show an association between income and happiness that is so much weaker than, if not inconsistent with, that shown by within-country comparisons, a Duesenberry-type model, involving relative status considerations as an important determinant of happiness, is suggested.},

  abstract = {Endemic uncertainties surrounding urban industrial waste raise important theoretical and methodological challenges for understanding the historical nature of cities. Our study advances a synthetic framework for engaging these challenges by extending theories of modern risk society and classic urban ecology to investigate the accumulation of industrial hazards over time and space. Data for our study come from a unique longitudinal dataset containing geospatial and organizational information on more than 2,800 hazardous manufacturing sites operating between 1956 and 2006 in Portland, Oregon. We pair these site data with historical data from the U.S. population census and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to examine the historical accumulation of hazardous parcels in relation to changing patterns of industrial land use, neighborhood composition, new residential development, and environmental regulation. Results indicate that historical accumulation of hazardous sites is scaling up in ways that exhibit little regard for shifting neighborhood demographics or existing regulatory policies as sites merge into larger, more contiguous industrialized areas of historically generated hazards, creating the environmental conditions of urban risk society.},

  abstract = {Caring work involves providing a face-to-face service to recipients in jobs such as child care, teaching, therapy, and nursing. Such jobs offer low pay relative to their requirements for education and skill. What explains the penalty for doing caring work? Because caring labor is associated with women, cultural sexism militates against recognizing the value of the work. Also, the intrinsic reward people receive from helping others may allow employers to fill the jobs for lower pay. Caring labor creates public goods--widespread benefits that accrue even to those who pay nothing. For example, if children learn skills and discipline from teachers, the children's future employers benefit, with no market mechanism to make the pay given to care workers reflect these benefits. Even when the public or not-for-profit sectors do step in to hire people to provide such services for those too poor to pay, the pay is limited by how much decision makers really care about the poor. Finally, the fact that people feel queasy about putting a price on something as sacred as care limits the pay offered--as paradoxical as it is to pay less for something when it is seen as infinitely valuable!},

  abstract = {In the last several decades, there has been a surge of interest in expertise in the social scientific, philosophical, and legal literatures. While it is tempting to attribute this surge of interest in expertise to the emergence and consolidation of a "knowledge society," "post-industrial society," or "network society," it is more likely that the debates about expertise are symptomatic of significant change and upheaval. As the number of contenders for expert status has increased, as the bases for their claims have become more diverse, and as the struggles between these would-be experts intensified, expertise became problematic and contested. In The Oxford Handbook of Expertise and Democratic Politics, Gil Eyal and Thomas Medvetz have brought together a broad group of scholars who have engaged substantively and theoretically with debates regarding the nature of expertise and the social roles of experts to examine these areas within sociology and allied disciplines. The analyses take an historical and relational approach to the topic and are motivated by the sense that growing mistrust in experts represents a danger to democratic politics today. Among the topics considered here are the value and relevance of the boundary between experts and laypeople; the causes and consequences of mistrust in experts; the meanings and social uses of objectivity; and the significance of recent transformations in the organization of the professions. Bringing together investigations from social scientists, philosophers, and legal scholars into the political dimensions of expertise, this Handbook connects interdisciplinary work done in science and technology studies with the more classic concerns, topics, and concepts of sociologists of professions and intellectuals.},

  abstract = {The caregiving research literature has explored and documented findings from psychological, clinical, and policy/program perspectives, but little is known regarding the contextual perspectives of caregiving. Temporal factors influence the structure and functioning of the caregiving family. The proposed paradigm adaptation extends a contextual perspective that addresses the exploration of the caregiving process as a temporal, dynamic, progressive process over time, in which decisions made by caregivers may not always be based on observable tasks but, nevertheless, may have important consequences. When cultures cross, attitudes and behaviors are modified, resulting from contact with a different set of values and beliefs. Cross-cultural research aims to explore these changes that take place over time. Future research should consider the inclusion of measures that assess the temporal aspect of caregiving and the acculturation considerations of family caregivers. These measures are especially needed because of the increased influence of international migration, economic globalization, and political conflicts in today's multicultural societies.},

  abstract = {Any thorough understanding of the modern epidemics of AIDS and tuberculosis in Haiti or elsewhere in the postcolonial world requires a thorough knowledge of history and political economy. This essay, based on over a decade of research in rural Haiti, draws on the work of Sidney Mintz and others who have linked the interpretive project of modern anthropology to a historical understanding of the largescale social and economic structures in which affliction is embedded. The emergence and persistence of these epidemics in Haiti, where they are the leading causes of youngadult death, is rooted in the enduring effects of European expansion in the New World and in the slavery and racism with which it was associated. A syncretic and properly biosocial anthropology of these and other plagues moves us beyond noting, for example, their strong association with poverty and social inequalities to an understanding of how such inequalities are embodied as differential risk for infection and, among those already infected, for adverse outcomes including death. Since these two diseases have different modes of transmission, different pathophysiologies, and different treatments, part of the interpretive task is to link such an anthropology to epidemiology and to an understanding of differential access to new diagnostic and therapeutic tools now available to the fortunate few.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This article draws from cumulative disadvantage and life course theories to develop a new theory for the social scientific study of aging. Design and Methods: Five axioms of cumulative inequality (CI) theory are articulated to identify how life course trajectories are influenced by early and accumulated inequalities but can be modified by available resources, perceived trajectories, and human agency. Results: Although the concept of CI has attracted considerable attention among social scientists, it holds promise for integrating additional disciplinary approaches to the study of aging including, but not limited to, biology, epidemiology, and immunology. The applicability of CI theory to gerontology is illustrated in research on the early origins of adult health. Implications: Primary contributions of the theory to gerontology include greater attention to family lineage as a source of inequality; genes, gestation, and childhood as critical to early and enduring inequalities; the onset, duration, and magnitude of exposures to risk and opportunity; and constraints on generalizations arising from cohort-centric studies.},

For decades, researchers have attempted to quantify the exact contribution of social factors, such as income, education, race/ethnicity, and the community environment, to health. The motivation is simple: understanding which social factors most affect health would help prioritize societal investments in those areas. However, most efforts to precisely quantify the influence of individual social determinants of health have failed, largely because the causal pathways are numerous, interconnected, and complex. Most empirical evidence has found that social factors matter in aggregate, but quantifying their individual contributions is difficult. After decades of efforts in this area, it may be time for a new approach.}

  abstract = {Background\enspace{} All over the world, the COVID-1\- 9 pandemic, not unlikely other epidemics, has hit harder people in low socioeconomic conditions. In Western countries, undocumented migrants are a growing component of this disadvantaged segment of the population. Their health conditions are frequently burdened by a number of chronic conditions, and they experience many difficulties in accessing public health services. Frequently, the only medical assistance they can get is provided by non-\- governmental organisations. Methods\enspace{} We studied the medical records (including pharmacological treatments) of all patients attending the outpatient clinics of Opera San Francesco (OSF; a big charity in Milano, Italy), in the first 5\,months of 2020. These comprise the outbreak of the pandemic and the lockdown period. The 1914 patients (1814 undocumented migrants and 100 Italians) seen during the lockdown were compared with those seen in the same period of 2019 and with those seen in the preceding months of 2020. We especially focused on three chronic conditions: cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and psychiatric disorders. Results\enspace{} The number of consultations during the first 5\,months of 2020 was much smaller than that of the same period of 2019. During the lockdown, we found 4048 consultations for 1914 patients, while they were 8051 in the same period of 2019 and 5681 in the first 2\,months of 2020. The quantity of medicines dispensed by OSF showed a marked decrease in the period of the study and mainly during the lockdown. The decrease in consultations and dispensation of medicines was most evident for psychiatric patients and almost not existent for patients with diabetes. Female patients suffered a more pronounced reduction. Conclusions\enspace{} Western countries need strategies to better assist the very poor during epidemics. Differences among different groups of disadvantaged persons should be taken into account when designing recovery plans.},

Participants with dementia typically preferred to conceal their diagnoses and acted accordingly, but progressive decline precluded perpetual concealment. Participants therefore gradually switched to a second type of management, displaying their impairments in specific ways to encourage favorable impressions. Cognitive inequities, and the prescriptiveness of diagnosis and care, granted carers increasing power over the presentation of selves. Such inequity is potentially problematic because cultural and institutional concerns can promote conflicting preferences within couples. The shifting distribution of self is hence bound up with structural constraints. A video abstract is available at https://tinyurl .com/ y3mj4d9f .},

We argue that in the neoliberal era market institutions increasingly use actuarial techniques to split and sort individuals into classification situations that shape life-chances. While this is a general and increasingly pervasive process, our main empirical illustration comes from the transformation of the credit market in the United States. This market works as both as a leveling force and as a condenser of new forms of social difference. The U.S. banking and credit system has greatly broadened its scope over the past twenty years to incorporate previously excluded groups. We observe this leveling tendency in the expansion of credit amongst lower-income households, the systematization of overdraft protections, and the unexpected and rapid growth of the fringe banking sector. But while access to credit has democratized, it has also differentiated. Scoring technologies classify and price people according to credit risk. This has allowed multiple new distinctions to be made amongst the creditworthy, as scores get attached to different interest rates and loan structures. Scores have also expanded into markets beyond consumer credit, such as insurance, real estate, employment, and elsewhere. The result is a cumulative pattern of advantage and disadvantage with both objectively measured and subjectively experienced aspects. We argue these private classificatory tools are increasingly central to the generation of ``market-situations'', and thus an important and overlooked force that structures individual life-chances. In short, classification situations may have become the engine of modern class situations. \'O 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper examines this question in relation to the use of the weight-loss drug Xenical by participants in an Internet forum for obese and overweight people. Ethnographic and interview data from the forum provides evidence that participants share information and support each other as they use Xenical, and in the process emerge as 'expert patients' in relation to their body shape and its treatment. However, it is argued that while an 'expert patient' can be perceived as desirable, enabling the democratisation of healthcare, it can also be constraining. The exchanges between the users in the forum perpetuate a biomedical model of overweight as a condition to be overcome. The discussion critically considers a number of options for the development of the expert patient, including the emergence of an 'informed consumer'.},

This paper sidesteps this dualism, instead considering places as sociomaterial assemblages of human and non-human materialities. It uses this posthuman and 'new materialist' perspective to explore how place-assemblages affect human capacities, in terms of both health and social dis/advantage. Based on secondary analysis of interview data on human/place interactions, it analyses the physical, sociocultural, psychological and emotional effects of place-assemblages, assessing how these produce opportunities for, and constraints upon human bodies. It than assesses how these emergent capacities affect both social dis/advantage and well-being. This analysis of how place-assemblages contribute positively or negatively to health and dis/advantage offers possibilities for further research and for social and public health policy.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to explore the relevance of the field of sociology of emotions for the sociology of health and illness. An existential-phenomenological perspective which emphasises subjectivity and the active expressive body is used to bridge the mind-body-society splits that characterise both fields. The paper briefly reviews some of the current literature in the sociology of emotions that tries to address the role of the body in emotional life and then draws on the works of Buytendijk and others on: 1) the form taken by emotional information and communication, 2) the grounding of the schema that structures feelings in bodily experience. This is followed by an outline of `unpleasant' and `pleasant' emotional`modes of being'. Such modes of being are physically expressed in neuro-hormonal, muscular skeletal forms and in the manner in which organism and environment exchange matter (eg breathing). The paper concludes by linking emotional modes of being to social structural features that impinge upon existence. Specifically, these social structural features include a person's social position (status) and the social control activities that accompany social relationships. This final section analyses dramaturgical stress and the social construction of emotional`false'consciousness. It is concluded that both the sociology of emotions and health and illness need to incorporate the concept of the living, embodied human subject and recent studies in bio-psycho-social research into their discourses. A focus on the emotionally expressive, embodied subject, who is active in the context of power and social control, can provide a useful approach for studying distressful feelings, society, and health.},

  abstract = {There are nearly 18 million family caregivers in the United States assisting an older adult in need of help. Identifying the caregivers in greatest need of support requires an understanding of the current social support networks available to family caregivers and whether specific groups of caregivers are at risk of having an insufficient support network.We collected personal network data from a nationally representative sample of 66 family caregivers to persons with dementia (PWDs) in the United States aged 18 and older, including information on network members' support to the caregiver and help to the care recipient.We found four common caregiving network types: large networks with many helpers; large networks primarily supporting caregivers; small, dense networks supporting both caregivers and care recipient; and small networks providing little help to either caregiver or care recipient. Gender, income, and geographic proximity of caregiver to the care recipient were significantly associated with caregiver network type.This study suggests that there are different types of care and support networks available to caregivers to PWDs, and that the size and structure of networks vary considerably among demographic groups. As the population ages, a better understanding of the supports available to caregivers will be crucial for ensuring that caregivers are adequately supported, and caregiving needs of families are met.},

Our approach builds on an understanding of public pedagogy to examine the pedagogical modes of address (Ellsworth 1997) that are (i) produced through `expert' discourses of mental health literacy for young people; and (ii) include digital practices created by young people as they seek to publicly address mental ill health through social media platforms. We trace the pedagogic modes of address that are evident in examples of digital mental health practices and the creation of what we call therapeutic publics. Through an analysis of mental health apps, we examine how these modes of address are implicated in the affective process of learning about mental (ill) health, and the affective arrangements through which embodied distress is rendered culturally intelligible. In doing so, we situate the use of individual mental health apps within a broader digital ecology that is mediated by therapeutic expertise and offer original contributions to the theorization of public pedagogy.},

It provides a template to encourage longitudinal research on reciprocal relationships between caregiver and care recipient because significant changes in the physical and/or mental health status of one member of the dyad will probably affect the physical and/or mental health of the partner. This article offers illustrative research projects employing this framework and concludes with a call to action and invitation to researchers to test components, share feedback, and participate in continued refinement to more quickly advance evidencebased knowledge and practice in the trajectory of dementia caregiving.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies from European countries noted that food products promoted on TV for children did not comply with international guidelines, including the World Health Organization European Nutrient Profile Model (WHO-ENPM) and the EU Pledge Nutrition Criteria (EU-PNC, an initiative developed by leading food companies). We aim to provide new data from Italy. DESIGN: Evaluation of Italian TV advertisements. Data on nutritional values for food product advertised were compared with nutritional standards issued by the WHO-ENPM and the EU-PNC. SETTING: In total, 180 h of TV programmes from six Italian channels, 2016-2017. PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred and ten consecutive advertisements during children's programmes. RESULTS: Out of 810 advertisements, 90 (11{$\cdot$}1 \%) referred to food products. Among these, 84{$\cdot$}5 \% of the foods promoted did not meet the WHO-ENPM and 55{$\cdot$}6 \% the EU-PNC guidelines. Advertisements promoting sweet and salty snacks (i.e. {$\geq$} 70 \% of all foods) v. other food products showed higher non-compliance with both the WHO-ENPM (OR: 73{$\cdot$}8; 95 \% CI: 4{$\cdot$}09, 1330) and the EU-PNC (OR: 9{$\cdot$}21; 95 \% CI: 2{$\cdot$}82, 30{$\cdot$}1). CONCLUSIONS: In Italy, most food advertisements during children's programmes are not compliant with European nutritional standards. Almost all the advertisements for snacks do not meet international guidelines. As the WHO-ENPM guidelines do not propose standards for all the food products, including meals, there is an urgent need to define independent and easy-to-read guidelines for food advertisements targeting children. As a first step towards the complete ban of food advertisements targeting children recommended by other researchers, these guidelines should be enforced by all the TV broadcasts.},

  abstract = {Positionalit\"at ist bis zum heutigen Tag von Sozialwissenschaftler(inne)n als zentrale Komponente in dem Prozess qualitativer (und bis zum einen gewissen Grad auch quantitativer) Datenerhebung konzeptionalisiert worden. Ziel des vorliegenden Beitrags ist es, auf dem Konzept der Positionalit\"at aufbauend insbesondere den Einfluss zu reflektieren, den die Klassen- und Generationszugeh\"origkeit auf die qualitative Migrationsforschung aus\"uben k\"onnen. Im Einzelnen argumentieren die Autoren, dass der Insiderstatus im Interview eine komplexere und vielschichtigere Gr\"o\ss e darstellt als weithin diskutiert. Die Verfasser behaupten, dass bei Interviews innerhalb der eigenen "kulturellen" Gemeinschaft Forschende -- als Insider -- ein Ausma\ss{} sozialer N\"ahe erreichen (k\"onnen), das paradoxerweise die Wachsamkeit der Forschenden und der "Beforschten" gegen\"uber den sozialen Trennlinien, die zwischen ihnen existieren, steigert. In dem vorliegenden Beitrag suchen die beiden Autoren ihre Behauptung anhand von zwei Beispielen zu belegen: zum einen untersucht eine italienische Forscherin italienische Zuwanderer(innen) in Nottingham (UK), zum anderen interviewte ein britischer Forscher Migrant(inn)en britischer Abstammung in Paris (Frankreich). Dabei wird zun\"achst gezeigt, wie Forschende im Interviewprozess "sozial-\"okonomisch aufsteigen", um dann darauf hinzuweisen, dass durch die M\"oglichkeit einer derartigen "Statusbewegung" -- wenn strategisch eine Beziehung hergestellt wird -- eine gewisse Machtungleichheit unausweichlich ist. Desweiteren werden -- unter Verweis auf die Konzepte des "Insiders" und des "unbeteiligten Beobachters" -- Wege vorgestellt, wie Forschende (zumindest teilweise) die Generationengrenzen innerhalb der eigenen "kulturellen" Gemeinschaft der Zuwanderer(innen) "\"uberwinden" k\"onnen. Diese methodologischen Reflektionen sind dazu gedacht, zuk\"unftige Untersuchungen, die innerhalb der (eigenen) Zuwanderungsgemeinschaft gef\"uhrt werden, zu unterst\"utzen und zu verbessern.

A close reading of these novels, contextualized against the background of scholarly debates about the representation of sexual violence, exposes both the perils and potential of cultural works to preserve the memory of rape in armed conflict.},

Results Without controlling for acculturation, participants with higher health literacy were 2.0 times more likely to have had preventive care (p=0.02). Subjects with higher word recognition were 1.8 times as likely to have had preventive care (p=0.04). Controlling for acculturation, these were no longer significant, and spoken proficiency was not associated with increased preventive care use. Discussion English health literacy and spoken proficiency were not associated with preventive dental care. Other factors, like acculturation, were more predictive of care use than language skills.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract This article strives to meet two challenges. As a review, it provides a critical discussion of the scholarship concerning undocumented migration, with a special emphasis on ethnographically informed works that foreground significant aspects of the everyday life of undocumented migrants. But another key concern here is to formulate more precisely the theoretical status of migrant ``illegality'' and deportability in order that further research related to undocumented migration may be conceptualized more rigorously. This review considers the study of migrant ``illegality'' as an epistemological, methodological, and political problem, in order to then formulate it as a theoretical problem. The article argues that it is insufficient to examine the ``illegality'' of undocumented migration only in terms of its consequences and that it is necessary also to produce historically informed accounts of the sociopolitical processes of ``illegalization'' themselves, which can be characterized as the legal production of migrant ``illegality.''},

  abstract = {Informal caregiving is a rewarding but demanding role. The present theoretical framework proposes to adapt the tridimensional concept of burnout to informal caregiving as a way to address the potential consequences of caregiving. This adaptation reflects caregivers' reported difficulties, as well as empirical findings on emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment as caregiving outcomes. But to understand burnout in informal caregiving contexts, it is also necessary to find ways to model it. The Informal Caregiving Integrative Model (ICIM) is thus proposed. This model is based on the integration of elements from literature on both informal caregiving stress and professional burnout. The goal of the ICIM is to emphasize the importance of every category of determinants of informal caregiver burnout (i.e., relating to the caregiver, the caregiving setting, and the sociocultural context), with a key mediating role for the caregivers' appraisal of their situation and their relationship with the care-recipient. This article is a first integrative step in the consideration of a form of burnout specific to informal caregivers and supports the design of empirical and interventional studies based on the theoretical foundation that the ICIM proposes.},

Targeted universalism, wellness-based local development, and Jedi Public Health approaches that are community informed, evidence based, and focused on improving everyday settings and diverse lived experiences are important policy directions. State and federal revenue transfers are necessary to mitigate the harms of austerity and assure greater equity in fiscal and population health in places like Detroit, Michigan. Context US population health inequity remains entrenched, despite mandates to eliminate it. To promote a public health approach of consequence in this domain, stakeholders call for moving from risk-factor epidemiology toward consideration of dynamic local variations in the physiological impacts of structured lived experience. Methods Using a community-based, participatory research approach, we collected and analyzed a unique data set of 239 black, white, and Mexican adults from a stratified, multistage probability sample of three Detroit, Michigan, neighborhoods. We drew venous blood, collected saliva, took anthropometric measurements, and assayed specimens to measure allostatic load (AL), an indicator of stress-mediated biological dysregulation, linking participants' AL scores and survey responses. In a series of nested Poisson models, we regressed AL on socioeconomic, psychosocial, neighborhood, and behavioral stressors to test the hypothesis that race/ethnicity and poverty-to-income ratio (PIR) are conceptually fluctuating variables whose impacts on AL are sensitive to structured lived experience. Findings White and Mexican Detroit participants with PIR {$<$} 1 have higher AL than counterparts nationally; black participants in Detroit and nationwide had comparable AL. Within Detroit, disparities by PIR were higher in whites than blacks, with no significant difference by PIR in Mexicans. The size of estimated effects of having PIR {$<$} 1 for whites is 58 percentage points greater than that of Mexicans and twice that of blacks. Conclusions Structurally rooted unobserved heterogeneity bias threatens the validity of independent main effects interpretations of associations between race/ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics, or place and health. One-size-fits-all analytic or policy models developed from the perspective of the dominant social group insufficiently address the experiences of diverse populations in specific settings and historical moments; nor do they recognize culturally mediated protective resources residents may have developed against material and psychosocial hardship.},

  abstract = {Is there a future for sociology? To many, sociology seems to have lost its way. Born of the ideas of Auguste Comte in the nineteenth century, sociology established itself as the science of modernity, linked to a progressive view of history. Yet today the idea of progress has more or less collapsed; with its demise, some say, sociological thought has moved to the margins of contemporary intellectual culture. In this book the author challenges such an interpretation, showing that sociology continues to hold a central position within the social sciences. Looking both to the past of sociology and the diversity of intellectual trends found in the present-day, Giddens explores many aspects of the sociological heritage. Comte, Durkheim, Parsons, Marshall, and Habermas are among the figures covered. Giddens also connects sociological work directly to current political issues and places the discipline of sociology in the context of broad questions of social and political theory. This book will be of interest to undergraduates and professionals in the fields of sociology, anthropology and political science.},

  abstract = {Background: Discrimination based on ethnicity and the lack of translation services in healthcare have been identified as main barriers to healthcare access. However, the actual experiences of migrant patients in Europe are rarely present in the literature. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess healthcare discrimination as perceived by migrants themselves and the availability of translation services in the healthcare systems of Europe. Methods: A total of 1407 migrants in 10 European Union countries (consortium members of the Mig-HealthCare project) were surveyed concerning healthcare discrimination, access to healthcare services, and need of translation services using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Migrants in three countries were excluded from the analysis, due to small sample size, and the new sample consisted of N = 1294 migrants. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to investigate the risk factors on perceived healthcare discrimination for migrants and refugees in the EU. Results: Mean age was 32 (\textpm 11) years and 816 (63.26\%) participants were males. The majority came from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, and Iran. Older migrants reported better treatment experience. Migrants in Italy (0.191; 95\% CI [0.029, 0.352]) and Austria (0.167; 95\% CI [0.012, 0.323]) scored higher in the Discrimination Scale to Medical Settings (DMS) compared with Spain. Additionally, migrants with better mental health scored lower in the DMS scale (0.994; 95\% CI [0.993, 0.996]), while those with no legal permission in Greece tended to perceive more healthcare discrimination compared with migrants with some kind of permission (1.384; 95\% CI [1.189, 1.611]), as opposed to Austria (0.763; 95\% CI [0.632, 0.922]). Female migrants had higher odds of needing healthcare assistance but not being able to access them compared with males (1.613; 95\% CI [1.183, 2.199]). Finally, migrants with chronic problems had the highest odds of needing and not having access to healthcare services compared with migrants who had other health problems (3.292; 95\% CI [1.585, 6.837]). Conclusions: Development of culturally sensitive and linguistically diverse healthcare services should be one of the main aims of relevant health policies and strategies at the European level in order to respond to the unmet needs of the migrant population.},

(2002) of a negative relationship between caregiving self-efficacy and depressive symptoms among family dementia caregivers. Female family caregivers (N = 74) of community-dwelling individuals diagnosed with dementia completed a telephone interview and self-report assessment packet that included measures of caregiving self-efficacy and depressive symptoms. There was a direct negative relationship between caregiving self-efficacy and depressive symptoms after controlling for objective stressors. There was no support, however, for the hypothesis that caregiving self-efficacy would operate as a moderator, such that the relationship between objective stressors (cognitive impairment and behavior problems) and caregivers' depressive symptoms would be strongest for caregivers reporting lower levels of self-efficacy. The results of this study suggest that caregiving self-efficacy has a strong, direct relationship with depressed symptoms for dementia family caregivers. Longitudinal research is needed to determine if it is an appropriate focus of future intervention research.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are chronic conditions that involve changes or loss of cognitive and social function. People living with dementia (PLWD) undergo a gradual expansion in caregiving needs, and many ultimately spend a portion of their lives in institutional settings, including nursing homes or assisted living facilities. This study uses a comparative ethnographic approach to examine how PLWD and their caregivers make sense of and navigate transitions from home to institutional care. It combines three years of detailed field observations and 84 in-depth interviews in California and Maine. Our data illustrate how socioeconomic inequality, disparate neighborhood contexts, and shared understandings of aging shape tensions caregivers experience as they navigate whether, how, and when to relocate PLWD for whom they care. Our results show cultural narratives encouraging independence and non-institutionalization of older adults intersect with caregivers' desires, structural positions, and local institutional resources -- creating tensions and are mentioned alongside the feeling of being burdened. These experiences and feelings emerge gradually as the health of PLWD declines and caregivers become aware of unmet needs and their own resource constraints. We unpack how diverse caregivers make sense of the burden they feel, define the thresholds to make decisions, map community resources, and experience a range of emotions such as frustration, guilt, and grief throughout the process. This contextualized analysis of how caregivers navigate ADRD decision-making offers insights into the affective nature of the process and the caregivers' fortitude.},

Research design: This is a qualitative study based on the grounded theory constant comparative method. Methods and procedures: Narratives of informal caregivers were collected through in-depth interviews with a psychologist. A three-step coding scheme was applied: coding of narratives to label the specific contents; organization of codes into sub-categories and categories; and theoretical coding to describe the relation between categories. Main outcomes and results: Twenty informal caregivers participated in one in-depth interview between December 2011 and May 2012. Four major themes emerged: Another person with past in common; Losing and finding myself; Old and new ways of being in relationship; and Dealing with concerns. These themes represent caregivers' efforts to deal with the situation in which their relative is at the same time present and absent. The core salient feature emerging from all these themes is the experience of ambiguous loss. Conclusions: Features of ambiguous loss that emerged in this study could guide clinicians' interventions to support adjustment of caregivers of patients with DOCs.},

Few programs have been translated for delivery in various service contexts, and they remain inaccessible to the 15+ million dementia family caregivers in the United States. This article examines translational efforts and offers a vision for more rapid advancement in this area. We summarize the evidence for caregiver interventions, review published translational efforts, and recommend future directions to bridge the research-practice fissure in this area. We suggest that as caregiver interventions are tested external to service contexts, a translational phase is required. Yet, this is hampered by evidentiary gaps, lack of theory to understand implementation challenges, insufficient funding and unsupportive payment structures for sustaining programs. We propose ways to advance translational activities and future research with practical applications.},

Caring partners as well as caregivers with financial burden due to the care situation were more exhausted and overloaded than other caregivers. The construct "exhaustion and overload" was closely associated with psychological distress, quality of life and sense of coherence. Offering psychological support for family caregivers should be an integral part of outpatient palliative care. Furthermore it is important to discuss the financial situation of family caregivers at the beginning of home care and refer them to appropriate support services if needed.},

  abstract = {The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was associated with a reduced number of Americans who reported being unable to afford medical care, but changes in actual health spending by households are not known.To estimate changes in household spending on health care nationwide after implementation of the ACA.Population-based data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2015, and multivariable regression were used to examine changes in out-of-pocket spending, premium contributions, and total health spending (out-of-pocket plus premiums) after the ACA's coverage expansions on January 1, 2014. The study population included a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 18 to 64 years (n\,=\,83\,431). In addition, changes were assessed in the likelihood of exceeding affordability thresholds for each outcome and spending changes for income subgroups defined under the ACA to determine program eligibility at 138\% or less, 139\% to 250\%, 251\% to 400\%, and greater than 400\% of the federal poverty level (FPL).Implementation of the ACA's major insurance programs on January 1, 2014.Mean individual-level out-of-pocket spending and premium payments and the percentage of persons experiencing high-burden spending, defined as more than 10\% of family income for out-of-pocket expenses, more than 9.5\% for premium payments, and more than 19.5\% for out-of-pocket plus premium payments.In this nationally representative survey of 83\,431 adults (weighted frequency, 49.1\% men and 50.9\% women; median age, 40.3 years; interquartile range, 28.6-52.4 years), ACA implementation was associated with an 11.9\% decrease (95\% CI, -17.1\% to -6.4\%; P\,\&lt;\,.001) in mean out-of-pocket spending in the full sample, a 21.4\% decrease (95\% CI, -30.1\% to -11.5\%; P\,\&lt;\,.001) in the lowest-income group ({$\leq$}138\% of the FPL), an 18.5\% decrease (95\% CI, -27.0\% to -9.0\%; P\,\&lt;\,.001) in the low-income group (139\%-250\% of the FPL), and a 12.8\% decrease (95\% CI, -22.1\% to -2.4\%; P\,=\,.02) in the middle-income group (251\%-400\% of the FPL). Mean premium spending increased in the full sample (12.1\%; 95\% CI, 1.9\%-23.3\%) and the higher-income group (22.9\%; 95\% CI, 5.5\%-43.1\%). Combined out-of-pocket plus premium spending decreased in the lowest-income group only (-16.0\%; 95\% CI, -27.6\% to -2.6\%). The odds of household out-of-pocket spending exceeding 10\% of family income decreased in the full sample (odds ratio [OR], 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.70-0.90) and in the lowest-income group (OR, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.97). The odds of high-burden premium spending increased in the middle-income group (OR, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.59).Implementation of the ACA was associated with reduced out-of-pocket spending, particularly for low-income persons. However, many of these individuals continue to experience high-burden out-of-pocket and premium spending. Repeal or substantial reversal of the ACA would especially harm poor and low-income Americans.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents has increased, and television viewing has been suggested as a cause. We examined the relation between hours of television viewed and the prevalence of overweight in 1990, and the incidence and remission of overweight from 1986 to 1990 in a nationally representative cohort of 746 youths aged 10 to 15 years in 1990 whose mothers were 25 to 32 years old. Overweight was defined as a body mass index higher than the 85th percentile for age and gender. RESULTS: We observed a strong dose-response relationship between the prevalence of overweight in 1990 and hours of television viewed. The odds of being overweight were 4.6 (95\% confidence interval, 2.2 to 9.6) times greater for youth watching more than 5 hours of television per day compared with those watching 0 to 2 hours. When adjustments were made for previous overweight (in 1986), baseline maternal overweight, socioeconomic status, household structure, ethnicity, and maternal and child aptitude test scores, results were similar (odds ratio, 5.3; 95\% confidence interval, 2.3 to 12.1). We also found significant relations between television viewing and increased incidence and decreased remission of overweight during this 4-year period, adjusted for baseline covariates. The adjusted odds of incidence were 8.3 (95\% confidence interval, 2.6 to 26.5) times greater for youth watching more than 5 hours of television per day compared with those watching for 0 to 2 hours. Estimates of attributable risk indicate that more than 60\% of overweight incidence in this population can be linked to excess television viewing time. CONCLUSION: Television viewing affects overweight among youth, and reductions in viewing time could help prevent this increasingly common chronic health condition.},

  abstract = {Aim Caregivers of dementia patients experience high levels of burden; this is especially true of caregivers of dementia patients with behavioural problems. As intervention studies for these caregivers are still lacking, we conducted an explorative pilot study into the efficacy of a support programme. Methods Participants were caregivers of dementia patients affected by apathy, disinhibition, and/or stereotypical behaviour. All patients had a Frontal Behavioural Inventory score of 11 or higher. Caregivers were randomized to the intervention group or control group (both n = 15). The intervention was a 6-month programme that consisted of psychoeducation, social support, and behavioural cognitive therapy. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected at baseline and after the intervention. Results An increased sense of competence was found in the intervention group. Burden, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms decreased, although the difference between the intervention and control groups was not significant. Conclusions Caregivers' sense of competence improved as a result of the support programme, and caregivers revealed its comprehensive supportive effects. Further research into the efficacy of the programme on a larger scale is recommended.},

P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons.Results 37\,819 adults were included in the study. Healthcare spending did not change in the first two years, but Medicaid expansions were associated with lower out-of-pocket spending (adjusted percentage change -28.0\% (95\% confidence interval -38.4\% to -15.8\%); adjusted absolute change -\$122 (\pounds 93; \texteuro 110); adjusted P\&lt;0.001), lower out-of-pocket plus premium spending (-29.0\% (-40.5\% to -15.3\%); -\$442; adjusted P\&lt;0.001), and lower probability of experiencing a catastrophic financial burden (adjusted percentage point change -4.7 (-7.9 to -1.4); adjusted P=0.01) in years three to four. No evidence was found to indicate that premium contributions changed after the Medicaid expansions.Conclusion Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care Act were associated with lower out-of-pocket spending and a lower likelihood of catastrophic financial burden for low income adults in the third and fourth years of the act's implementation. These findings suggest that the act has been successful nationally in improving financial risk protection against medical bills among low income adults.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Acute laboratory stressors elicit elevations in serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Chronic stressors, such as family dementia caregiving, promote a state of chronic low-grade elevation in circulating inflammatory markers. The recurrent daily stressors associated with chronic stress may lead to repeated and sustained activation of the physiological stress systems. The present study evaluated the possibility that greater exposure and reactivity to daily stressors fueled increased levels of circulating inflammatory markers among family dementia caregivers, compared with noncaregiving controls. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 53 caregivers and 77 noncaregiving controls. A semistructured interview assessed the occurrence of daily stressors in the past 24 h. A blood sample provided data on two inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). RESULTS: Caregivers were more likely to experience multiple stressors in the past 24 h than noncaregiving controls. The occurrence of multiple daily stressors was associated with greater serum IL-6 and CRP levels. The greater occurrence of daily stressors in the past 24 h partially mediated the relationship between dementia caregiving and CRP levels. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the cumulative effect of daily stressors promotes elevations in inflammatory markers. Greater exposure to daily stressors may be a psychobiological mechanism leading to elevations in CRP levels among family dementia caregivers.},

  abstract = {Background:Caregiving for a relative with dementia has been associated with negative consequences for mental health. Self-efficacy has been shown to correlate negatively with depression but the long-term association between caregiver burden, caregiver self-efficacy, and depressive symptoms, remains still largely unexplored. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether different self-efficacy domains partially mediated the relationship between caregiving burden and depression.Methods:A three-wave design was used, with initial assessment and follow-ups three months later and one year later. One hundred seventy caregivers of patients with AD responded to measures of caregiver burden, caregiving self-efficacy, and depressive symptoms. Data were analyzed by means of structural equation models.Results:The tested model provided support for the guiding hypothesis. Burden at the time of the first assessment (T1) significantly influenced depression one year later and the relationship between burden at time one and depressive symptoms one year later was partially mediated by self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts.Conclusions:The findings of the present study provide evidence that, along a considerable length of time, the effects of caregiver burden on depressive symptoms can be explained by the caregivers' efficacy beliefs in controlling upsetting thoughts related to the caregiving tasks. Interventions for caregivers of patients with AD may help them in tackling negative thoughts about the caregiving role.},

People living with dementia or mental health disorders as well as informal carers have been separately described as socially excluded. The objective of this systematic narrative review was to examine the extent to which social exclusion experienced by adult informal carers of people living with dementia or severe mental health disorders has been identified and described in research literature. It synthesised qualitative and quantitative evidence and included the perspectives of carers themselves and of professionals. Eight electronic databases (1997--2017) were searched. Five relevant studies published between 2010 and 2016 were identified. All were qualitative and used interviews and focus groups. Study quality was variable and most were European. Two focused on carers of people living with dementia and three on carers of people with mental health disorders. Four investigated carers' perspectives and experiences of social exclusion directly (total of 137 carer participants, predominantly parents, spouses and adult children), while the fifth focused on the perceptions of 65 participants working in health and social care. Stigma, financial difficulties and social isolation were highlighted in four studies and the challenges for carers in engaging in leisure activities were described in the fifth. Most conceptualised social exclusion as a form of stigma, or as resulting from stigma. One presented social exclusion as an element of carer burden. Two explicitly discussed the negative effects of social exclusion on carers. The dearth of research and the lack of specificity about social exclusion in carers was surprising. Future research should investigate aspects of social exclusion that may adversely affect carer wellbeing.},

But this begs the question: What is it about women's jobs that causes them to pay less? We argue that emotional labor offers the missing link in the explanation. Tasks that require the emotive work thought natural for women, such as caring, negotiating, empathizing, smoothing troubled relationships, and working behind the scenes to enable cooperation, are required components of many women's jobs. Excluded from job descriptions and performance evaluations, the work is invisible and uncompensated. Public service relies heavily on such skills, yet civil service systems, which are designed on the assumptions of a bygone era, fail to acknowledge and compensate emotional labor.},

  abstract = {Families caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease (AD) soon discover that it is unlike any other illness. Coping with a degenerative brain disease is much different than dealing with a physical disability. AD is more disruptive to, and has greater impact on, the family than other chronic diseases. AD caregiving carries with it a high financial, social, and emotional price. Families must work toward effectively coping with the disease, decreasing the harmful effects on the family, and keeping family conflicts to a minimum. Support groups can provide families with much-needed information on the disease, emotional and practical support, and an expressive or advocacy outlet. Formal services can help relieve some of the burden of caring for an AD patient. Family members must remember that there is no ``right'' way to care for a person with AD, and each family must determine, with the help of the appropriate professionals and services, how to best meet its own needs. Given the burdens of care, however, even small interventions may translate into improvements in the quality of life or confidence of the caregiver.},

In this report, we describe physical activity levels worldwide with data for adults (15 years or older) from 122 countries and for adolescents (13-15-years-old) from 105 countries. Worldwide, 31{$\cdot$}1\% (95\% CI 30{$\cdot$}9-31{$\cdot$}2) of adults are physically inactive, with proportions ranging from 17{$\cdot$}0\% (16{$\cdot$}8-17{$\cdot$}2) in southeast Asia to about 43\% in the Americas and the eastern Mediterranean. Inactivity rises with age, is higher in women than in men, and is increased in high-income countries. The proportion of 13-15-year-olds doing fewer than 60 min of physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity per day is 80{$\cdot$}3\% (80{$\cdot$}1-80{$\cdot$}5); boys are more active than are girls. Continued improvement in monitoring of physical activity would help to guide development of policies and programmes to increase activity levels and to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases.},

An intraprofessional movement for psychosocial pediatrics led to alterations in the specialty's stated jurisdiction. One explanation for the movement's origins is that demand for treating sick children was eroding; primary-care providers took up the delivery of behavioral services to avoid extinction. This paper shows that routinization of work, not market decline, preceded psychosocial pediatrics. Academicians rather than community practitioners spearheaded boundary expansion. The movement's major consequence appears to be a new division of labor between pediatricians and other health care professionals rather than increased pediatric treatment of children's psychosocial disorders.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Watching television in childhood and adolescence has been linked to adverse health indicators including obesity, poor fitness, smoking, and raised cholesterol. However, there have been no longitudinal studies of childhood viewing and adult health. We explored these associations in a birth cohort followed up to age 26 years. METHODS: We assessed approximately 1000 unselected individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1972-73 at regular intervals up to age 26 years. We used regression analysis to investigate the associations between earlier television viewing and body-mass index, cardiorespiratory fitness (maximum aerobic power assessed by a submaximal cycling test), serum cholesterol, smoking status, and blood pressure at age 26 years. FINDINGS: Average weeknight viewing between ages 5 and 15 years was associated with higher body-mass indices (p=0.0013), lower cardiorespiratory fitness (p=0.0003), increased cigarette smoking (p{$<$}0.0001), and raised serum cholesterol (p=0.0037). Childhood and adolescent viewing had no significant association with blood pressure. These associations persisted after adjustment for potential confounding factors such as childhood socioeconomic status, body-mass index at age 5 years, parental body-mass index, parental smoking, and physical activity at age 15 years. In 26-year-olds, population-attributable fractions indicate that 17\% of overweight, 15\% of raised serum cholesterol, 17\% of smoking, and 15\% of poor fitness can be attributed to watching television for more than 2 h a day during childhood and adolescence. INTERPRETATION: Television viewing in childhood and adolescence is associated with overweight, poor fitness, smoking, and raised cholesterol in adulthood. Excessive viewing might have long-lasting adverse effects on health.},

  abstract = {In recent years U.S. public policy has focused on strengthening the nuclear family as a primary strategy for improving the lives of America's youth. It is often assumed that this normative type of family is an independent, self-sufficient unit adequate for raising children. But half of all households in the United States with young children have two employed parents. How do working parents provide care and mobilize the help that they need? In Not-So-Nuclear Families: Class, Gender, and Networks of Care, Karen V. Hansen investigates the lives of working parents and the informal networks they construct to help care for their children. She chronicles the conflicts, hardships, and triumphs of four families of various social classes. Each must navigate the ideology that mandates that parents, mothers in particular, rear their own children, in the face of an economic reality that requires that parents rely on the help of others. In vivid family stories, parents detail how they and their networks of friends, paid caregivers, and extended kin collectively close the "care gap" for their school-aged children. Hansen not only debunks the myth that families in the United States are independent, isolated, and self-reliant units, she breaks new theoretical ground by asserting that informal networks of care can potentially provide unique and valuable bonds that nuclear families cannot.

This article assesses how migrants in Europe experience access, treatment and outcomes in the European health care systems. Methods Data were obtained from the QUALICOPC study (Quality and Costs of Primary Care in Europe). Regression analyses were used to estimate the access, treatment and outcomes of care for ethnic minorities. Results In several countries, migrants experience that the opening hours of their GP practice were too limited and indicate that the practice was too far away from their work or home (lower access). They are more likely to report negative patient--doctor communication and less continuity of care than native patients (worse treatment). In addition, they are less satisfied with the care they received and are more likely to postpone care (worse outcomes). Conclusions In general, migrants are still disadvantaged during the health care process. However, our results also indicate that satisfaction with the health care process improves for second-generation migrants in comparison with first-generation migrants.},

  abstract = {The plasticity of cultural constructs of dementia is shown in two societies: Japan, and an American Indian nation. By demedicalizing the analysis of dementia, the social and cultural factors that influence recognition of symptoms, help-seeking strategies, caregiving behaviors, and adherence to biomedical and sociocultural coping advice become more obvious. Notably in the Japanese example, motivation toward primary prevention behavior is clear in the context of boke since it is an undesirable condition of frailty and cognitive decline considered to be preventable by remaining active. In the American Indian example, the hallucinatory symptoms are positively valued communications with the ``other side'' rather than pathologically defined. The findings show the need to extend dementia models beyond the biomedical in order to optimize prevention and management of this complex, chronic condition.},

Sections cover: The standard university-course specifications of contemporary writing, offering an extensive picture of the social, economic, and cultural contexts of these literary genres The impact and status of non-literary writing, and how this compares with certain literary genres as an index to contemporary culture and a reflection of the state of the publishing industry The practicalities and conventions of the publishing industry Contextual aspects of literary culture and the book industry, visiting the broader spheres of publishing, promotion, bookselling and literary culture Carefully linked chapters allow readers to tie key elements of the publishing industry to the particular demands and features of contemporary literary genres and writing, offering a detailed guide to the ways in which the three core areas of culture, economics and pragmatics intersect in the world of publishing. Further to being a valuable resource for those studying English or Creative Writing, the volume is a key text for degrees in which Publishing is a component, and is relevant to those aspects of Media Studies that look at interactions between the media and literature/publishing"--},

It is generally understood that such actions may be a response to the social and physical environment, yet very little attention has been paid to understanding what role the environment plays in eliciting and responding to these actions across different settings. Drawing on 27 semi-structured interviews with formal and informal carers, this article examines how carers understand the actions of people with dementia in relation to their environment. We identify individual, interpersonal, local environmental, macro-scale and temporal dynamics that influence the actions of people with dementia and carers' capacities to work with them. Drawing on relational thinking and the concept of structural violence, we argue that many of the problems and solutions associated with aggressive actions are located outside the person with dementia in broader relations and systems of care. We conclude with a discussion of how these understandings can inform developments in the systems of home and community care.},

Nuanced understandings of distress are needed to inform mental health and public health programming. The purpose of this research was to examine distress from the perspectives of young immigrant and refugee men living in Greater Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Thirty-three young men (aged 15--22\,years) from diverse immigrant and refugee backgrounds participated in interviews, which were conducted between 2014 and 2015. Data were examined using narrative analysis and theories of masculinities. Three narratives were identified---norming distress, acknowledging distress as ongoing, and situating distress. The findings reveal that the narratives offer different frames through which distress was rendered a norm, or acknowledged and situated in relation to the participants' relationships and to masculine discourses that shaped their expressions of distress. The findings can inform initiatives aimed at providing spaces for diverse young men to acknowledge their distress and to receive support for mental health challenges.},

We utilise this concept to inform our analysis of 18 qualitative interviews with five people with dementia and four informal carers. Our participants are members of a pre-existing group of dementia advocates, representing the voices of those living with the condition. There are a growing number of people in the early stages of dementia -- like our participants -- being called upon to account for their experience, as a means of developing a politicised `collective illness identity'. These interviews present an opportunity to study a group of people who are actively involved in speaking as, and for, people with dementia. Four themes emerged from the data: becoming a voice of or for people with dementia; biographical reinforcement; responsibilisation; and resistance. These themes illustrate the ways in which people with dementia participate in their own identity construction and, as representatives of those living with dementia, they also illustrate the ways in which illness narratives produce material and symbolic value.},

A narrative approach is used to show how family caregivers draw on their cultural and personal resources to create stories about the nature and meaning of illness and to ask how ethnic identity may influence the kinds of stories family caregivers tell. Three different story types are identified and described, each with a distinctive configuration of illness meanings and overarching theme, or storyline: a subset of African-American, Irish-American, and Chinese-American caregivers told us stories about Alzheimer's as a disease that erodes the core identity of a loved one and deteriorates their minds; a subset of Chinese caregivers narrated stories that emphasized how families managed confusion and disabilities, changes ultimately construed as an expected part of growing old; a subset of Puerto Rican and Dominican families, while using the biomedical label of Alzheimer's disease or dementia, placed the elder's illness in stories about tragic losses, loneliness, and family responsibility. To construct their stories, caregivers drew upon both biomedical explanations and other cultural meanings of behavioral and cognitive changes in old age. Their stories challenge us to move beyond the sharp contrast between ethnic minority and non-ethnic minority views of dementia-related changes, to local clinics and hospitals as sites where biomedical knowledge is interpreted, communicated, discussed, and adapted to the perspectives and lived realities of families.},

  abstract = {Introduction High rates of hospital visits and readmissions are common among persons living with dementia, resulting in frequent transitions in care and care coordination. This paper identifies and evaluates existing measures of transitions and care coordination for persons living with dementia and their caregivers. Methods This integrative review builds off a prior review using a systematic search of online databases (PubMed, EBSCO, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Scopus) to identify records and locate reports (or articles) that use measures of care transitions and care coordination. Identified measures were compared to the Alzheimer's Association's Dementia Care Practice Recommendations to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the measure in this population, such as if measures were person- and family-centered. Results Seventy-one reports using measures of transitions in care and care coordination for persons living with dementia and their caregivers were identified. There were multiple measures identified in some reports. Three main areas of measures were classified into: identification of the population (3 measures, 8 reports), transitional care and care coordination delivery (14 measures, 17 reports), and transitional care and care coordination outcomes (e.g., health-care use, cost, and mortality; 17 measures, 60 reports). A strength of the three main areas of measures was that a portion of the measures were person- and family-centered. Variability in the operational definitions of some measures and time intensiveness of collecting the measure (e.g., number of items, the time it takes to complete the items) were common weaknesses. Discussion Transitions and care coordination measures are varied across studies targeted at persons living with dementia and their caregivers. Existing measures focus heavily on outcomes, specifically health-care resource use, and cost, rather than the elements of transitional care or care coordination. Future measure development focused on care transitions and service coordination is needed.},

  abstract = {This study investigates whether transitions into and out of unpaid caregiving are associated with increased risk for onset of or delayed recovery from psychological distress, and traces the prevalence of distress across successive years of caring activity and after caregiving has ceased. The analysis is based on data from the British Household Panel Survey covering 3000 would-be carers, 2900 former carers, and 11,100 non-carers during the 1990s; their psychological wellbeing was assessed at annual intervals using the General Health Questionnaire. Carers providing long hours of care over extended spells present raised levels of distress, women more so than men. Compared with non-carers, risk for onset of distress increases progressively with the amount of time devoted to caregiving each week. Adverse effects on the psychological well-being of heavily involved carers are most pronounced around the start of their care episodes and when caregiving ends. Ongoing care increases their susceptibility to recurring distress, and adverse health effects are evident beyond the end of their caregiving episodes. Several groups of carers experience psychological health inequalities compared with non-carers, especially those looking after a spouse or partner, and mothers caring for a sick or disabled child. The findings underline the importance for effective carer support and health promotion of early identification of carers, monitoring high risk groups, timing appropriate interventions, and targeting resources.},

  abstract = {Medicalization is frequently defined as a process by which some non-medical aspects of human life become to be considered as medical problems. Overdiagnosis, on the other hand, is most often defined as diagnosing a biomedical condition that in the absence of testing would not cause symptoms or death in the person's lifetime. Medicalization and overdiagnosis are related concepts as both expand the extension of the concept of disease. They are both often used normatively to critique unwarranted or contested expansion of medicine and to address health services that are considered to be unnecessary, futile, or even harmful. However, there are important differences between the concepts, as not all cases of overdiagnosis are medicalizations and not all cases of medicalizations are overdiagnosis. The objective of this article is to clarify the differences between medicalization and overdiagnosis. It will demonstrate how the subject matter of medicalization traditionally has been non-medical (social or cultural everyday life) phenomena, while the subject matter of overdiagnosis has been biological or biomolecular conditions or processes acknowledged being potentially harmful. They also refer to different types of uncertainty: medicalization is concerned with indeterminacy, while overdiagnosis is concerned with lack of prognostic knowledge. Medicalization is dealing with sickness (sick role) while overdiagnosis with disease. Despite these differences, medicalization and overdiagnosis are becoming more alike. Medicalization is expanding, encompassing the more ``technical'' aspects of overdiagnosis, while overdiagnosis is becoming more ideologized. Moreover, with new trends in modern medicine, such as P4 (preventive, predictive, personal, and participatory) medicine, medicalization will become all-encompassing, while overdiagnosis more or less may dissolve. In the end they may converge in some total ``iatrogenization.'' In doing so, the concepts may lose their precision and critical sting.},

A cultural model approach drawn from cognitive anthropology is taken to focus on how Chinese caregiving daughters develop a sense of what is right and emotionally fulfilling and acquire the motivation to care for their parents. An ethnographic approach was used in the study and techniques included guided and open-ended interviews and non-participatory observations. A total of 20 co-residential caregiving daughters were interviewed in their homes on average twice over the course of one year. All interviews were conducted in Cantonese. Although the sample was small, daughters' accounts are structured by reference to cultural models and this structure provides the common basis for generalisability of results. Concepts of Confucian antecedents, reciprocity and personhood and other modern ideas of filial duty are explored. Conclusions are drawn about the shifting rights and obligations of Chinese caregiving daughters within the contemporary urban realities of Hong Kong. The findings of this study have relevance for the development of welfare policy for older Chinese persons and the chronically ill, and to all services involving women. The findings will also serve to inform family caregiver education programs. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Patients with vascular dementia (VaD) are often isolated, withdrawn from society because of negative symptoms and functional disabilities. The aim of this study was to detect factors associated with social withdrawal in patients with VaD. The participants were 36 institutionalized patients with VaD. Social withdrawal was assessed with the social withdrawal of the Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects (MOSES). Possible explanatory variables were the MOSES items depression and self-care, Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), apathy evaluation scale (AES), and Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Frequency-Weighted Severity Scale (BEHAVE-AD-FW). Multiple regression analyses were conducted for two groups: Analysis 1 was performed in all patients (N = 36) and Analysis 2 was performed in the patients with the ability to move by themselves (i.e., independent walking or independent movement with a cane or a wheelchair; n = 28). In Analysis 1, MOSES item social withdrawal was correlated with AES and MOSES item self-care. In Analysis 2, MOSES item social withdrawal was correlated with AES and CASI domain abstraction and judgment. Decreased social activities of VaD were not related to general cognitive function or depression. Disturbed activities of daily living (ADLs) for self-care may involve decreased frontal lobe function, indicating that comprehensive rehabilitation for both ADL and dementia are needed to improve the social activities of patients with VaD.},

  abstract = {The epidemiology of flourishing is an important research topic prompting international interest in its psychometric assessment. But the need to measure human feelings and functioning at the population level has resulted in the creation of a multitude of different conceptual frameworks of flourishing: a term now commonly used to describe high levels of subjective wellbeing.

Agreement between Seligman, and Huppert and So's, operationalizations was moderate (74\%). Taken together, and in line with recent OECD recommendations, our findings reinforce the need for greater international collaboration and conceptualisation consensus when measuring flourishing. In the absence of any published empirical research investigating perceptions of flourishing among laypersons, a prototype analysis investigating alignment between lay and academic conceptualisations of flourishing is recommended.},

The author argues that this notion only fits a small number of serious psychological conditions, and that most conditions regarded as mental illness are cultural constructions, normal reactions to stressful social circumstances, or simply forms of deviant behavior. According to the author, the formulation of mental illness as disease benefits various interest groups, including mental health researchers and clinicians, prescriptive drug manufacturers, and mental health advocacy groups, all of whom promote disease based models. Presenting case studies in maladies such as hysteria, multiple personality disorder, and depression, the author examines the major causes and treatments of mental illness, paying special attention to the use of pharmaceuticals. While biologically based causes and treatments fit some entities formulated, the author finds that more often than not, social responses offer far more suitable remedies.

  abstract = {Laypeople as well as mental health professionals typically assume that the nature, causes, and cures of mental illness are aspects of distressed individuals. Mental illness, as a cultural category, is rooted in personalizes or brains. These individualistic conceptions of mental illness are entrenched in both common sense and the mental health professions that define, study, and treat mental illness. Sociologists who study mental health and illness thus confront deeply rooted and socially legitimated a-sociological models. This chapter outlines four sociological styles of thinking about mental disorders. Each reacts in a distinct way to the dominant individualistic model of mental illness. The most common style accepts the prevailing definitions of mental illness and searches for the social causes of these conditions. A second style, more common in anthropology and history than in sociology, examines how individual symptoms are cultural products of particular sociohistorical contexts. Both of these approaches address the social causes of symptoms but make different assumptions about whether psychological conditions emerge independently of cultural contexts or are integral aspects of these contexts. Two other sociological orientations do not address how symptoms arise in individuals but instead focus on how social factors affect responses to mental disorder. One of these approaches uses traditional measures of mental illness as a base and studies the variation in the reaction to these symptoms. The other examines how social definitions of mental disorders are constructed and employed. Both the etiological (I) and sociological psychology (II) approaches study how particular individuals develop mental disorders. In contrast, the social response (III) and social constructionist (IV) schools explain the ways in which social groups define and respond to individuals who display symptoms. The second basis of classification is whether mental symptoms are viewed as properties of individuals or as cultural products. Etiological (I) and social response (III) studies either see symptoms as emerging independently of culture or take the nature of symptoms for granted, respectively. In contrast, the major goal of both sociological psychology (II) and social constructionist (IV) explanations is to understand how culture produces expressions and definitions of psychological conditions. The remainder of this chapter discusses the nature, strengths, and weaknesses of these four styles of sociological explanation of mental disorder Although these four approaches encompass the dominant sociological modes of studying mental disorder, this classification does not capture the great heterogeneity within each style or the often fuzzy boundaries between them. There is no single sociological style of explaining mental illness; instead, a variety of explanations illuminate a phenomenon that is not usually considered to be within the social domain at all.

It begins with a brief biographical outline of Giddens' career to date, following with an overview of his central themes and concepts. The theme of self-identity and the concepts of the reflexive self, trust, risk, expert systems and claims of truth, offer a way to interrogate the field of modern healthcare. It is proposed that the notion of the reflexive self, in particular, has the capacity to explain some of the ways in which contemporary individuals contemplate not only their health but also medical care in general. These ideas are applied to the notion of consumer choice and the view that there are a number of competing health service providers from whom consumers may choose the best fit therapy for their `lifestyle'. The corollary of this is a sense of relativism, where the historical authority of the medical and pharmaceutical industries is challenged by increasingly popular competing healthcare industries, which contest the scientific method and offer alternative epistemologies through which to contemplate health, and treat illness.},

  abstract = {Informal caregiving continues to be a crucial part of health and social care provision in the developed world, but the processes by which the identity of informal caregiver is conferred, or assumed, remain unclear. In this article we draw on data from a qualitative research study which examined the experiences of family members and friends of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) to explore how they interpret the label `carer'. We conducted narrative interviews with forty people throughout the United Kingdom between June 2011 and January 2012. Participants were spouses, partners, parents, children, siblings or friends of people who have had multiple sclerosis between 6 months and fifty years. We carried out thematic analysis of the interviews, informed by identity theory. Identity theory illuminated variation in peoples' perceptions of themselves as carers, suggesting that self-identification with the role and label of carer is nuanced, shifting and variable. We propose a taxonomy of caring activity including emotional support, personal care, physical care, household tasks, advocacy and activism and describe four categories, with fluid and overlapping boundaries, in which the identity of carer was apparently embraced, enforced, absorbed or rejected. Variability and fluidity in self-identification as a carer are related to apparent expectations about whether one should assume a caring role. Those who were caring from the more tangential (and less taken for granted) relationship of sibling or ex-partner were among those who apparently embraced the role. Those who were expected to assume the caring role (typically spouses) were not always comfortable with doing so. It may be difficult to gain acknowledgement from family members and others that they occupy the role of carer if people resist the label as a bureaucratisation of their personal relationships.},

This critical review summarizes the findings of recent systematic reviews and primary research on the impact of post-migration conditions on mental disorders and PTSD among refugees and asylum seekers. Historically, the focus of mental health research and interventions with these populations has been on the impact of pre-migration trauma. Pre-migration trauma does predict mental disorders and PTSD, but the post-migration context can be an equally powerful determinant of mental health. Moreover, post-migration factors may moderate the ability of refugees to recover from pre-migration trauma. The importance of post-migration stressors to refugee mental health suggests the need for therapeutic interventions with psychosocial elements that address the broader conditions of refugee and asylum seekers? lives. However, there are few studies of multimodal interventions with refugees, and even fewer with control conditions that allow for conclusions about their effectiveness. These findings are interpreted using a social determinants of health framework that connects the risk and protective factors in the material and social conditions of refugees? post-migration lives to broader social, economic and political factors.},

  abstract = {Age-related dementias present a significant health concern in Canada, particularly for Indigenous communities, in which rates of dementia are estimated to be 34 per cent higher than in the general Canadian population. This article reports on a qualitative evidence synthesis of available literature concerning cultural understandings of dementia in Indigenous peoples in Canada. Key findings suggest that although exploration of this topic is on the rise in Canada, there remains a paucity of research on this topic, particularly among the Inuit and M\'etis. The synthesis of the literature found that dementia is viewed as a natural part of the life cycle by many Indigenous people; and although this presents significant challenges for caregivers, informal and community models of care are routinely practiced. This synthesis will be useful for health care providers and organizations that are searching for appropriate approaches to respond to the needs of Indigenous patients and families experiencing dementia., Les d\'emences li\'ees \`a l'\^age constituent un probl\`eme de sant\'e important au Canada, en particulier chez les communaut\'es autochtones, o\`u les taux de d\'emences surpassent d'environ 34 \% ceux retrouv\'es dans la population canadienne. Cette \'etude pr\'esente une synth\`ese des donn\'ees qualitatives tir\'ees des articles traitant de la compr\'ehension culturelle des d\'emences chez les peuples autochtones du Canada. Les r\'esultats principaux sugg\`erent que peu de recherches ont \'et\'e effectu\'ees dans ce domaine, en particulier chez les Inuits et les M\'etis, malgr\'e une progression de l'exploration de ce sujet au Canada. La synth\`ese de la litt\'erature a r\'ev\'el\'e que la d\'emence est per\c cue comme une partie naturelle du cycle de vie par de nombreux Autochtones. Bien que les mod\`eles communautaires et informels de soins soul\`event d'importants d\'efis pour les aidants naturels, ils sont r\'eguli\`erement appliqu\'es. Cette synth\`ese sera utile pour les organismes et les prestataires de soins de sant\'e qui recherchent des approches appropri\'ees pour r\'epondre aux besoins des patients et des familles autochtones aux prises avec la d\'emence.},

  abstract = {There is a need in South Africa to understand the status of available care and support to strengthen responses to dementia. This study provides a situational analysis of the current provisions of health, care and support for older persons, people living with dementia and their families in South Africa. It is a first step towards describing the landscape of needs and services available, and provides an evidence base to inform priority-setting for strengthening responses to dementia in South Africa. This situational analysis was conducted in three phases: (1) a desk review guided by a comprehensive topic guide which includes the WHO's Global Dementia Observatory indicators; (2) multi-sectoral stakeholder interviews to verify the secondary sources used in the desk review, and to identify gaps and opportunities in policy and service provisions; and (3) a SWOT-analysis examining the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in current care and support provisions in South Africa. Our findings highlight the gaps and opportunities with current service provision and show how structural factors create barriers to diagnosis, support, and care. There is an urgent need for intersectoral policy responses to support and strengthen current health, social care, and long-term support systems so that people living with dementia and their families can live and age well. This paper forms part of a larger study on strengthening responses to dementia (The STRIDE project).},

We argue that much of the current research on forced migration is based on unsound methodology, and that the data and subsequent policy conclusions are often flawed or ethically suspect. This paper identifies some key methodological and ethical problems confronting social scientists studying forced migrants or their hosts. These problems include non-representativeness and bias, issues arising from working in unfamiliar contexts including translation and the use of local researchers, and ethical dilemmas including security and confidentiality issues and whether researchers are doing enough to `do no harm'. The second part of the paper reviews the authors' own efforts to conduct research on urban refugees in Johannesburg. It concludes that while there is no single `best practice' for refugee research, refugee studies would advance its academic and policy relevance by more seriously considering methodological and ethical concerns.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: People with dementia (PwD) frequently use emergency care services. To mitigate the disproportionately high rate of emergency care use by PwD, an understanding of contributing factors driving reliance on emergency care services, and identification of feasible alternatives is needed. This study aimed to identify clinician, caregiver, and service providers' views and experiences of unmet needs leading to emergency care use among community-dwelling PwD, and alternative ways of addressing these needs. DESIGN: Qualitative, employing semi-structured interviews with clinicians, informal caregivers, and aging service providers. SETTING: Wisconsin, United States. PARTICIPANTS: Informal caregivers of PwD (4), emergency medicine physicians (4), primary care physicians (5), geriatric healthcare providers (5), aging service providers (6), and community paramedics (3). MEASUREMENTS: Demographic characteristics of participants and data from semi-structured interviews. FINDINGS: Four major themes were identified from interviews: 1) system fragmentation influences emergency care use by PwD, 2) informational, decision-making, and social support needs influence emergency care use by PwD, 3) ED are not designed to optimally address PwD and caregiver needs, and 4) options to prevent and address emergency care needs of PwD. CONCLUSION: Participants identified numerous system and individual-level unmet needs, and offered many recommendations to prevent or improve ED use by PwD. These novel findings, aggregating the perspectives of multiple dementia-care stakeholder groups, serve as the first step to developing interventions that prevent the need for emergency care or deliver tailored emergency care services to this vulnerable population through new approaches.},

Can changes in the way insurance measures the value of behaviour really serve as an example of the individual and social harms of datafication? How do we know? Insurance is a mathematical relationship staged between individuals and groups, between risk and uncertainty, between distribution and assessment, between the value of sharing and the sharing of value. We use the case study of Discovery International, owner of Vitality, the market leading brand in behavioural insurance to consider how behaviour is being branded and how the brand behaves.},

  abstract = {Multiple studies have shown that quality of care for dementia in primary care is poor with physician adherence to dementia quality indicators (QIs) ranging from 18-42\%. In response, the University of California, Los Angeles Health System created the UCLA Alzheimer's and Dementia Care (ADC) Program, a quality improvement program that uses a co-management model with a nurse practitioner dementia care manager (DCM) working with primary care physicians and community-based organizations to provide comprehensive dementia care. Our objective was to measure the quality of dementia care provided by nurse practitioner DCMs using the Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders (ACOVE-3) and Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement QIs., Participants included 797 community-dwelling adults with dementia referred to the UCLA ADC program over a two-year period. UCLA is an urban academic medical center with primarily fee-for-service reimbursement. We measured the percentage of recommended care received for 17 dementia QIs. The primary outcome was aggregate quality of care for the UCLA ADC cohort calculated as the total number of recommended care processes received divided by the total number of eligible quality indicators. Secondary outcomes included aggregate quality of care in three domains of dementia care: assessment and screening (7 QIs), treatment (6 QIs), and counseling (4 QIs). QIs were abstracted from DCM notes over a three-month period from date of initial assessment., Patients were eligible for 9,895 QIs, of which 92\% were passed. Overall pass-rates among DCMs were similar (range 90\% to 96\%). All counseling and assessment QIs had pass-rates {$>$}80\% with most exceeding 90\%. Wider variation in adherence was found among QIs addressing treatments for dementia, which were triggered by patient-specific criteria, ranging from 27\% for discontinuation of medications associated with mental status changes to 86\% for discussion about acetylcholinesterase inhibitors., Comprehensive dementia care co-management with a nurse practitioner can result in very high quality of care for dementia, especially for assessment, screening and counseling. The effect on treatment QIs is more variable but higher than previous reports of physician-provided dementia care.},

The emerging use of social media platforms-such as TikTok, Clubhouse, and Facebook-by people with dementia and dementia caregivers enables new forms of sharing about stigmatized, poorly understood, and often under-discussed experiences. Building on prior work focused on formal support groups, we report findings from an interview study of how people living with dementia and dementia caregivers provide and receive social support through emerging online spaces and communities. Our analysis reveals that both groups cultivate new online spaces for sharing about the experience of dementia while also navigating tensions surrounding public disclosure of lived experiences, advocacy, education, and the ability to protect and keep private elements of life experiences. We discuss how these groups cultivate online spaces across platforms and contribute to ongoing ethical debates about consent in online communities. We conclude with questions that guide future work on emerging online spaces for supporting people living with dementia and caregivers of people living with dementia.},

The authors review two areas in which sociological theories and methods have made significant contributions to the study of inequalities and AI: (1) the politics of algorithms, data, and code and (2) the social shaping of AI in practice. The authors contrast sociological approaches that emphasize intersectional inequalities and social structure with other disciplines' approaches to the social dimensions of AI, which often have a thin understanding of the social and emphasize individual-level interventions. This scoping article invites sociologists to use the discipline's theoretical and methodological tools to analyze when and how inequalities are made more durable by AI systems. Sociologists have an ability to identify how inequalities are embedded in all aspects of society and to point toward avenues for structural social change. Therefore, sociologists should play a leading role in the imagining and shaping of AI futures.},

  abstract = {In this paper we centrally explore the `sociogenesis' of the concept of happiness: the social processes by which it came to be a term appropriated by different practitioner communities - from policy makers to academics, from a burgeoning self-help industry to advocates of positive psychology. Our core focus is upon shifting historical understandings of the term and how these relate to more general social processes. Our aim in this paper is not to present a definitive history of happiness, but rather something of the overall direction of changes in dominant approaches to, and understandings of, happiness particularly within what we might broadly term `the human sciences'. Ultimately, we offer a series of tentative reflections upon the implications of a developmental approach to happiness for sociological analyses of this increasingly popular area of concern.},

  abstract = {Purpose Due to the rapid ageing of the continent's population, a significant surge in long-term care expenses for the elderly is expected across Europe in the coming years. Could a potential solution to this challenge involve the increased informal care provided by adult children? In this context, we examined a general view or moral duty of European citizens regarding whether adult children should assume responsibility for providing long-term care to the elderly. Design/methodology/approach Our multilevel analysis draws on individual-level data from the 2017 European Value Study and country-level data from various European sources encompassing participants from 21 member countries of the European Union. Findings The findings reveal that in nations where public long-term care services are sufficiently available and of superior quality, there is a negative sentiment towards the notion that adult children should bear the responsibility for elderly care. In total, 71\% of the country-level variance in our dependent variable was explained by the availability and quality of formal long-term care in a country. Furthermore, various individual-level attributes contribute to shaping attitudes towards care-giving responsibility. We observed that women, middle-aged individuals, those without religious affiliations, those with modern gender role attitudes and non-immigrants tended to hold unfavourable attitudes towards the responsibility of adult children in long-term care provision. Originality/value There are relatively many studies on the general attitude of the population towards filial obligation. However, so far there have been very few studies available that examine the population's attitude towards the obligation of adult children to commit to their parents' long-term care. Our research explains the variation of the phenomenon in Europe with both country-level and individual-level factors.},

Providing evidence on the prevalence of carer anxiety is critical as it can enhance awareness among professionals, which in turn can lead to improved access to efficacious treatments. This meta-analysis updated the previous review conducted in 2007 to estimate the up-to-date prevalence of anxiety in informal carers for people with dementia. Literature searches were conducted in databases of published and unpublished literature. Events and sample size data were pooled using a random effects model to obtain an overall prevalence percentage. A total of 10 studies were included, resulting in a pooled estimate of anxiety prevalence at 32.1\% (95\% confidence interval: 20.6\%-46.2\%, P = .01). Significant heterogeneity was found, which was not reduced following sensitivity analysis. This study suggests anxiety is a prevalent difficulty experienced by dementia carers. Additional research recommendations and clinical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined whether patients with language barriers receive worse hospital care in terms of quality or efficiency. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patients' primary language influences hospital outcomes. DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational cohort of urban university hospital general medical admissions between July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2003. PATIENTS: Eighteen years old or older whose hospital data included information on their primary language, specifically English, Russian, Spanish or Chinese. MEASUREMENTS: Hospital costs, length of stay (LOS), and odds for 30-day readmission or 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Of 7023 admitted patients, 84\% spoke English, 8\% spoke Chinese, 4\% Russian and 4\% Spanish. In multivariable models, non-English and English speakers had statistically similar total cost, LOS, and odds for mortality. However, non-English speakers had higher adjusted odds of readmission (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.7). Higher odds for readmission persisted for Chinese and Spanish speakers when compared to all English speakers (OR, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.2-2.3 and OR, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.0-2.3 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: After accounting for socioeconomic variables and comorbidities, non-English speaking Latino and Chinese patients have higher risk for readmission. Whether language barriers produce differences in readmission or are a marker for less access to post-hospital care remains unclear.

  abstract = {Due to an expected increase of people in need of care, sound knowledge about health effects of informal care provision is becoming more and more important. Theoretically, there might be positive as well as negative health effects due to caregiving to relatives. Moreover, we suppose that such health effects differ by national context - since care is differently organized in Europe - and depend on the social setting in which the care relationship takes place. Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement (SHARE, waves 1, 2, 3, and 5) and from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA, waves 2-5) we examined the connection between informal caregiving and self-perceived as well as mental health in a country comparative perspective. Taking advantage of the longitudinal structure of the data, pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) and fixed-effects models (FEM) were estimated. Our results show distinct differences in the relationship between reported health and the provision of informal care depending on whether individuals give care to someone inside or outside the household. Caregivers inside the household reported worse health, caregivers from outside the household reported better health than non-caregivers. We find that this correlation is largely due to selection into caregiving: people in worse health took up care inside while people in better health took up care outside the household. However, in most countries people who started caregiving inside the household experienced a decline in their mental health. This suggests that caregiving inside the household results in psychological stress irrespective of the type of welfare state. The results regarding self-perceived health and caregiving outside the household are less distinct. All in all our results show that health consequences of caregiving vary not only between different welfare regimes but also between countries of similar welfare state types.},

We examine the process as it is recalled, and further elaborated, in post-diagnostic interviews as part of a collaborative inquiry during reflections with clinicians and patients in the northeastern United States. Rather than treating assumptions by patients and providers as a fixed attribute of an individual, we treat them as occurring between people within a particular social context, the diagnostic interview. We explore the diagnostic interview as a landscape in which assumptions occur (and can shift), navigate the features of this landscape, and suggest that our examination can best be achieved by the systematic comparison of views of the multiple actors in an experience-near manner. We describe what might be gained by this shift in assumptions and how it can make visible what is at stake for clinician and patient in their local moral worlds -- for patients, acknowledgement of social suffering, for clinicians how assumptions are a barrier to engagement with minority patients. It is crucial for clinicians to develop this capacity for reflection when navigating the interactions with patients from different cultures, to recognize and transform assumptions, to notice `surprises', and to elicit what really matters to patients in their care.},

It was hypothesized, in this study, that income inequality is related to reduction in social cohesion and that disinvestment in social capital is in turn associated with increased mortality. METHODS: In this cross-sectional ecologic study based on data from 39 states, social capital was measured by weighted responses to two items from the General Social Survey: per capita density of membership in voluntary groups in each state and level of social trust, as gauged by the proportion of residents in each state who believed that people could be trusted. Age-standardized total and cause-specific mortality rates in 1990 were obtained for each state. RESULTS: Income inequality was strongly correlated with both per capita group membership (r = -.46) and lack of social trust (r = .76). In turn, both social trust and group membership were associated with total mortality, as well as rates of death from coronary heart disease, malignant neoplasms, and infant mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the notion that income inequality leads to increased mortality via disinvestment in social capital.},

STUDY DESIGN: TV and other screen device use, including smartphones, tablets, computers, and/or videogames, was self-reported by a nationally representative, cross-sectional sample of 24\,800 US high school students (2013-2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys). Students also reported on health behaviors including sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, physical activity, sleep, and weight and height. Sex-stratified logistic regression models, adjusting for the sampling design, estimated associations between TV and other screen device use and SSB intake, physical activity, sleep, and obesity. RESULTS: Approximately 20\% of participants used other screen devices for {$\geq$}5 hours daily. Watching TV {$\geq$}5 hours daily was associated with daily SSB consumption (aOR\,=\,2.72, 95\% CI: 2.23, 3.32) and obesity (aOR\,=\,1.78, 95\% CI: 1.40, 2.27). Using other screen devices {$\geq$}5 hours daily was associated with daily SSB consumption (aOR\,=\,1.98, 95\% CI: 1.69, 2.32), inadequate physical activity (aOR\,=\,1.94, 95\% CI: 1.69, 2.25), and inadequate sleep (aOR\,=\,1.79, 95\% CI: 1.54, 2.08). CONCLUSIONS: Using smartphones, tablets, computers, and videogames is associated with several obesity risk factors. Although further study is needed, families should be encouraged to limit both TV viewing and newer screen devices.},

The sense that legislation and education against stigma is sufficient may explain the shortage of interest in research in this field.

AIMS: The purpose of this concept analysis is to address fundamental gaps in the understanding of self-efficacy in family caregivers of older adults with cognitive impairment, including updating the 26-year-old concept analysis with a contemporary definition. METHODS: This study utilizes Walker and Avant's (2019) concept analysis method, an eight-step iterative process that helps to clarify ambiguous concepts. A literature review was conducted from July 1993 through March 2019 using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and Embase. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed research articles and review articles that included family caregivers of older adults with cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Eight defining attributes of this concept are identified. The revised definition of self-efficacy in this population is a family caregiver's confidence in their ability to: manage behaviors and other caregiving stresses, control upsetting thoughts, acquire medical information, manage medical issues, obtain self-care, access community supports, assist with activities of daily living and other care, and maintain a good relationship with a relative, friend, or neighbor of an older adult with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: This paper utilizes over a quarter-century of research to build on the original analysis by Mowat and Spence Laschinger (1994) and update the concept's definition. This analysis should provide researchers with a clearer understanding of this concept and a renewed emphasis on the importance of targeting interventions to improve self-efficacy in this vulnerable caregiving population.},

Methods This study utilizes Walker and Avant's (2019) concept analysis method, an eight-step iterative process that helps to clarify ambiguous concepts. A literature review was conducted from July 1993 through March 2019 using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and Embase. Inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed research articles and review articles that included family caregivers of older adults with cognitive impairment. Results Eight defining attributes of this concept are identified. The revised definition of self-efficacy in this population is a family caregiver's confidence in their ability to: manage behaviors and other caregiving stresses, control upsetting thoughts, acquire medical information, manage medical issues, obtain self-care, access community supports, assist with activities of daily living and other care, and maintain a good relationship with a relative, friend, or neighbor of an older adult with cognitive impairment. Conclusion This paper utilizes over a quarter-century of research to build on the original analysis by Mowat and Spence Laschinger (1994) and update the concept's definition. This analysis should provide researchers with a clearer understanding of this concept and a renewed emphasis on the importance of targeting interventions to improve self-efficacy in this vulnerable caregiving population.},

  abstract = {Overproduction of IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine, is associated with a spectrum of age-related conditions including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, periodontal disease, frailty, and functional decline. To describe the pattern of change in IL-6 over 6 years among older adults undergoing a chronic stressor, this longitudinal community study assessed the relationship between chronic stress and IL-6 production in 119 men and women who were caregiving for a spouse with dementia and 106 noncaregivers, with a mean age at study entry of 70.58 (SD = 8.03) for the full sample. On entry into this portion of the longitudinal study, 28 of the caregivers' spouses had already died, and an additional 50 of the 119 spouses died during the 6 years of this study. Levels of IL-6 and health behaviors associated with IL-6 were measured across 6 years. Caregivers' average rate of increase in IL-6 was about four times as large as that of noncaregivers. Moreover, the mean annual changes in IL-6 among former caregivers did not differ from that of current caregivers even several years after the death of the impaired spouse. There were no systematic group differences in chronic health problems, medications, or health-relevant behaviors that might have accounted for caregivers' steeper IL-6 slope. These data provide evidence of a key mechanism through which chronic stressors may accelerate risk of a host of age-related diseases by prematurely aging the immune response.},

South Korea considers informal caregivers both as resources and co-clients, but its well-being support is limited, financial aid criteria are relatively strict, and while employment-care reconciliation policies exist, familistic culture hinders their use. The United Kingdom assigns co-worker and co-client roles, offering well-being support, broader financial aid, and expanding employment-care reconciliation. Sweden prioritises formal care and recognises informal caregivers as co-clients, placing the strongest emphasis on improving their well-being while strictly regulating financial aid and employment-care reconciliation. Despite differences, all three countries emphasise informal caregiver well-being and have established frameworks for financial support and employment-care reconciliation policies. Future policies should enhance quality control, regulate financial aid, strengthen employment-care reconciliation support, and expand formal care, while addressing the potential negative impacts of dual caregiver roles.},

Although previous studies identified various predictors of caregiver burden, these predictors have not been confirmed in nationally representative population. Methods. Data for this secondary analysis was provided by the National Alliance for Caregiving, American Association of Retired Persons. The data were collected through a telephone survey of randomly selected adults in seven states in 2003 (weight adjusted n = 302). Descriptive statistics, inter-correlation analysis and a hierarchical multiple regression analysis were performed. Results/findings. Disease-related factors were the most significant predictors, explaining 16\% of caregiver burden; these were followed by caregiver sociodemographical factors and caregiving-related factors (F = 21\AE 28, P {$<$} 0\AE 01). Significant individual predictors were impairment of activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living, the number of hours of caregiving, use of coping strategies, co-residence, spousal status and caregiver gender (P {$<$} 0\AE 05). Conclusion. Impaired function in care-recipients predicts caregiver burden, and also interacts with demographical- and caregiving-related factors. Thus, it will be beneficial to both care-recipients and caregivers to target nursing interventions and community services to improve the functional abilities of individuals with dementia.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Self-determination theory (SDT) may be a useful framework to understand why chronic pain affects partners. SDT postulates that individuals can engage in helping behaviors for different motives varying from more autonomous or volitional motives to more controlled or pressured motives. This article examines the relationship between partners' type of motivation to help (i.e., autonomous vs controlled) and their personal and relational functioning. Furthermore, mechanisms underlying this relationship (i.e., helping exhaustion and relationship-based need satisfaction) were examined. METHODS: In a sample of 48 couples, of which one partner had chronic pain (36 female patients), questionnaires measuring life satisfaction, positive and negative affect, anxiety and depressive feelings, relationship quality and relationship-based need satisfaction were filled out. Individuals with chronic pain (ICPs) also reported on pain intensity and disability whereas partners were requested to report on motives for helping and helping exhaustion. RESULTS: Data analysis with Structural Equation Modeling revealed that autonomous, relative to controlled, motives for helping among partners related positively to partners' well-being and relationship quality, and negatively to distress. The experience of helping exhaustion and relationship-based need satisfaction mediated these associations. Moreover, partners' autonomous helping motivation related positively to patient-reported relationship quality among ICPs high in pain intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Applying SDT in a context of pain provides new insights into why chronic pain affects partners and how partners impact patient outcome. Directions for future research are outlined.},

However, as exemplified in many East Asian cultures, happiness assumes a different subjective form---it is a state that emerges when taking a critical and disciplined stance to the personal self and thus engaging the sympathy of others. The authors' theoretical perspective assumes that the self and social relations of a given community are mutually constitutive and that being a self amounts to being part of the attendant social relations. This chapter deconstructs the notion of happiness as typically used and taken for granted in the contemporary Western social science literature on the topic by drawing a comparison between contemporary North American culture and contemporary Japanese culture. Empirical research on the correlates of subjective well-being, as well as sympathy and interpersonal reciprocity is examined. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

The article focuses on the personal story of a woman who migrated from the United States (US) to Australia, and whose sense of disconnection and displacement in relation to everyday life is embedded within a narrative of depression. Our discussion of her twin narratives of emotional distress and migration is located within theoretical debates about depression, migration and the constitution of subjectivity. In particular, we draw on psychoanalytical approaches to subjectivity to argue that her emotional distress and the medical diagnosis of depression together represent a form of `experienc[ing] oneself as a subject' (Butler, 2005), and function as a precondition to her narrative of migration. Ultimately, we conclude, the woman's intertwined narratives of depression and migration operate simultaneously to provide retroactive order to her subjectivity.},

The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework of caregiving phases across the Alzheimer's disease and caregiving trajectories and the corresponding caregiver support needs. Materials and methods: Constructivist grounded theory informed data collection and analysis. 40 spousal (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 20) and adult children (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 20) caregivers were interviewed. Recruitment was completed when theoretical saturation was achieved. Member-checking interviews occurred with 10 participants. Results: Participants described five phases of caregiving related to their responsibilities to support people with Alzheimer's disease including monitoring initial symptoms, navigating their diagnosis, assisting with instrumental activities of daily living, assisting with basic activities of daily living, and preparing for the future. Support (i.e., informational, emotional, instrumental, and appraisal) needs were often specific to the phase of care. For example, during the initial symptoms phase, caregivers reported needing information to assist them to distinguish normal aging from cognitive impairment. In contrast, during the preparing for the future phase, caregivers emphasized support for accessing institutional long termcare placement. Conclusions: Findings highlight caregiver-identified phases of caregiving and corresponding support needs across the Alzheimer's disease trajectory. Findings can inform the development, evaluation and implementation of programs and services to meet caregivers' changing needs across the disease trajectory.},

This emerging subfield of dementia studies puts the body and embodied practices at the center of explorations of how dementia is represented and/or experienced. This shift towards a greater recognition of the way that humans are embodied has expanded the horizon of dementia studies, providing the intellectual and narrative resources to examine experiences of dementia, and their interconnections with history, culture, power, and discourse. Our aim in this paper is to critically explore and review dimensions of this expanding research and literature, specifically in relation to three key narratives: (1) rethinking selfhood: exploring embodied dimensions; (2) surveillance, discipline, and the body in dementia and dementia care; and (3) embodied innovations in dementia care practice. We argue that this literature collectively destabilizes dementia as a taken-for-granted category and has generated critical texts on the interrelationship between the body and social and political processes in the production and expression of dementia.},

Shaped by academic fields, industries, national contexts, technologies and platforms, and languages and cultures, for over two decades netnography has impacted the research practices of scholars around the world. In this volume, thirty-two researchers present nineteen chapters that examine how they have adapted netnography and what those changes can teach us. Positioned for students and researchers in academic and professional fields, this book examines how we can better use netnographic research to understand the many ways networked technologies affect every element of contemporary business life and consumer existence. Netnography Unlimited provides an unprecedented new look at netnography. From COVID-19 to influencer empathy, gambling and the Dark Web to public relations and the military, AI and more-than-human netnography to video-streaming and auto-netnography, there has never been a wider or deeper treatment of technocultural netnographic research in one volume. Readers will learn what kind of work they can do with netnography and gain an up-to-date understanding of the most pressing issues and opportunities.

  abstract = {Investigating effects of discrimination upon health requires clear concepts, methods, and measures. At issue are both economic consequences of discrimination and accumulated insults arising from everyday and at times violent experiences of being treated as a second-class citizen, at each and every economic level. Guidelines for epidemiologic investigations and other public health research on ways people embody racism, sexism, and other forms of social inequality, however, are not well defined, as research in this area is in its infancy. Employing an ecosocial framework, this article accordingly reviews definitions and patterns of discrimination within the United States; evaluates analytic strategies and instruments researchers have developed to study health effects of different kinds of discrimination; and delineates diverse pathways by which discrimination can harm health, both outright and by distorting production of epidemiologic knowledge about determinants of population health. Three methods of studying health consequences of discrimination are examined (indirect; direct, at the individual level, in relation to personal experiences of discrimination; at the population level, such as via segregation), and recommendations are provided for developing research instruments to measure acute and cumulative exposure to different aspects of discrimination.},

This is particularly true in the case of the most marginalised migrants, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, who work as itinerant laborers harvesting fruits and vegetables in southern Italy. This study analyzes demographic and health data gathered by a non-governmental organization-run primary healthcare clinic in order to understand the challenges these migrants face when trying to maintain their health. Results show that their health suffers greatly due to substandard living and working conditions, partially due to the fact that these individuals experience many barriers when trying to access care from the national health system. The health status of this population cannot improve without broad reforms to the welfare system and the agricultural sector. Government action is needed to ensure that such individuals are not denied their basic human rights and freedoms, including the right to health.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This paper aimed to describe the burden experienced by informal caregivers supporting a person with dementia (PwD) who lives at home and utilizes a dementia care network (DCN), to investigate the factors that are associated with caregiver burden, and to identify possible differences in caregiver burden among different types of DCNs. METHOD: This study was part of a multi-center, interdisciplinary evaluation of DCNs in Germany (DemNet-D). Cross-sectional data were collected in face-to-face interviews with people with dementia (PwDs) and their caregivers, and 13 DCNs were represented. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess caregiver burden, challenging PwD behaviors, functional competence and caregiver health status. Based on qualitative data, four DCN governance types were used in a multivariate analysis of burden categories. RESULTS: There were 560 PwD-caregiver dyads enrolled in the study. Informal caregivers (n = 536) reported a low-to-moderate burden associated with PwD characteristics (instrumental activities of daily living, challenging behaviors) and caregiver characteristics (gender) as well as the relationship between the caregivers and PwDs. Women felt more burdened but also showed higher levels of personal development. No differences were observed among the different DCN governance types. CONCLUSIONS: DCNs might contribute toward moderate to low caregiver burden. Indicators of positive caregiving aspects can be used by DCNs to advance support structures for informal caregivers drawing upon interventions already established for other community settings. Particular interest should be paid to female and spousal caregivers who might be in in need of greater and/or different kinds of support.},

In this book three prominent social thinkers discuss the implications of "reflexive modernization" for social and cultural theory today.Ulrich Beck's vision of the "risk society" has already become extraordinarily influential. Beck offers a new elaboration of his basic ideas, connecting reflexive modernization with new issues to do with the state and political organization.Giddens offers an in-depth examination of the connections between "institutional reflexivity" and the de-traditionalizing of the modern world. We are entering, he argues, a phase of the development of a global society. A "global society" is not a world society, but one with universalizing tendencies.Lash develops the theme of reflexive modernization in relation the aesthetics and the interpretation of culture. In this domain, he suggests, we need to look again at the conventional theories of postmodernism; "aesthetic modernization" has distinctive qualities that need to be uncovered and analyzed.In the concluding sections of the book, the three authors offer critical appraisals of each other's viewpoints, providing a synthetic conclusion to the work as a whole.},

We conducted an observational netnography to identify and analyze posts in a publicly accessible online community (discussion forum boards) designed for older people. A Straussian grounded theory approach was used to examine 659 posts in health-related message boards. Self-care support involved the construction of three interrelated identities: (1) the support seeking self, in which members described problems and requested information; (2) the empathizing self, in which they described similar experiences and offered support; and (3) the influencing self, in which they provided information or advice. Online communities appear to be an important source of peer support and information and may be a cost-effective approach to supplement standard care.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence is increasingly influencing the opinions and behavior of people in everyday life. However, the over-representation of men in the design of these technologies could quietly undo decades of advances in gender equality. Over centuries, humans developed critical theory to inform decisions and avoid basing them solely on personal experience. However, machine intelligence learns primarily from observing data that it is presented with. While a machine's ability to process large volumes of data may address this in part, if that data is laden with stereotypical concepts of gender, the resulting application of the technology will perpetuate this bias. While some recent studies sought to remove bias from learned algorithms they largely ignore decades of research on how gender ideology is embedded in language. Awareness of this research and incorporating it into approaches to machine learning from text would help prevent the generation of biased algorithms. Leading thinkers in the emerging field addressing bias in artificial intelligence are also primarily female, suggesting that those who are potentially affected by bias are more likely to see, understand and attempt to resolve it. Gender balance in machine learning is therefore crucial to prevent algorithms from perpetuating gender ideologies that disadvantage women.},

  abstract = {Background: There is increasing attention paid to the arrival of migrants from outwith the EU region to the European countries. Healthcare that is universally and equably accessible needs to be provided for these migrants throughout the range of national contexts and in response to complex and evolving individual needs. It is important to look at the evidence available on provision and access to healthcare for migrants to identify barriers to accessing healthcare and better plan necessary changes. Methods: This review scoped 77 papers from nine European countries (Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, Spain, and Sweden) in English and in country-specific languages in order to provide an overview of migrants' access to healthcare. The review aims at identifying what is known about access to healthcare as well as healthcare use of migrants and refugees in the EU member states. The evidence included documents from 2011 onwards. Results: The literature reviewed confirms that despite the aspiration to ensure equality of access to healthcare, there is evidence of persistent inequalities between migrants and non-migrants in access to healthcare services. The evidence shows unmet healthcare needs, especially when it comes to mental and dental health as well as the existence of legal barriers in accessing healthcare. Language and communication barriers, overuse of emergency services and underuse of primary healthcare services as well as discrimination are described. Conclusions: The European situation concerning migrants' and refugees' health status and access to healthcare is heterogeneous and it is difficult to compare and draw any firm conclusions due to the scant evidence. Different diseases are prioritised by different countries, although these priorities do not always correspond to the expressed needs or priorities of the migrants. Mental healthcare, preventive care (immunization) and long-term care in the presence of a growing migrant older population are identified as priorities that deserve greater attention. There is a need to improve the existing data on migrants' health status, needs and access to healthcare to be able to tailor care to the needs of migrants. To conduct research that highlights migrants' own views on their health and barriers to access to healthcare is key.},

  abstract = {Cash-for-care (CfC) schemes are monetary transfers to people in need of care who can use them to organize their own care arrangements. Mostly introduced in the 1990s, these schemes combine different policy objectives, as they can aim at (implicitly or explicitly) supporting informal caregivers as well as increasing user choice in long-term care or even foster the formalization of care relations and the creation of care markets. This article explores from a comparative perspective, how CfC schemes, within broader long-term care policies, envision, frame, and aim to condition informal care, if different models of relationships between CfC and informal care exist and how these have persisted or changed over time and into which directions. Building on the scholarly debate on familialization vs. defamilialization policies, the paper proposes an analytical framework to investigate the trajectories of seven European countries over a period of 20 years. The results show that, far from being simply instruments of supported familialism, CfC schemes have contributed to a turn towards ``optional familialism through the market,'' according to which families are encouraged to provide family care and are (directly or indirectly) given alternatives through the provision of market care.},

  abstract = {Among the most damaging characteristics of the covid-19 pandemic has been its disproportionate effect on disadvantaged communities. As the outbreak has spread globally, factors such as systemic racism, marginalisation, and structural inequality have created path dependencies that have led to poor health outcomes. These social determinants of infectious disease and vulnerability to disaster have converged to affect already disadvantaged communities with higher levels of economic instability, disease exposure, infection severity, and death. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are an important part of the health informatics toolkit used to fight contagious disease. AI is well known, however, to be susceptible to algorithmic biases that can entrench and augment existing inequality. Uncritically deploying AI in the fight against covid-19 thus risks amplifying the pandemic's adverse effects on vulnerable groups, exacerbating health inequity. In this paper, we claim that AI systems can introduce or reflect bias and discrimination in three ways: in patterns of health discrimination that become entrenched in datasets, in data representativeness, and in human choices made during the design, development, and deployment of these systems. We highlight how the use of AI technologies threaten to exacerbate the disparate effect of covid-19 on marginalised, under-represented, and vulnerable groups, particularly black, Asian, and other minoritised ethnic people, older populations, and those of lower socioeconomic status. We conclude that, to mitigate the compounding effects of AI on inequalities associated with covid-19, decision makers, technology developers, and health officials must account for the potential biases and inequities at all stages of the AI process.},

  abstract = {After more than a decade of concerted effort by policy-makers in Canada and elsewhere to encourage older adults to age at home, there is recognition that the ageing-in-place movement has had unintended negative consequences for family members who care for seniors. This paper outlines findings of a qualitative descriptive study to investigate the health and wellness and support needs of family caregivers to persons with dementia in the Canadian policy environment. Focus groups were conducted in 2010 with 23 caregivers and the health professionals who support them in three communities in the Southern Interior of British Columbia. Thematic analysis guided by the constant comparison technique revealed two overarching themes: (1) forgotten: abandoned to care alone and indefinitely captures the perceived consequences of caregivers' failed efforts to receive recognition and adequate services to support their care-giving and (2) unrealistic expectations for caregiver self-care relates to the burden of expectations for caregivers to look after themselves. Although understanding about the concepts of caregiver burden and burnout is now quite developed, the broader sociopolitical context giving rise to these negative consequences for caregivers to individuals with dementia has not improved. If anything, the Canadian homecare policy environment has placed caregivers in more desperate circumstances. A fundamental re-orientation towards caregivers and caregiver supports is necessary, beginning with viewing caregivers as a critical health human resource in a system that depends on their contributions in order to function. This re-orientation can create a space for providing caregivers with preventive supports, rather than resorting to costly patient care for caregivers who have reached the point of burnout and care recipients who have been institutionalised.},

We argue that individuals' tendency to be a bridge between otherwise unconnected people can affect body mass index. Furthermore, health-specific resources flowing through their networks might interact with this network-structural position to shape this association. Using multivariate analyses of recent nationally representative data on older Americans, we find that occupying a bridging position within a network is negatively related to the likelihood of being obese. Moreover, people who have this bridging potential tend to benefit more from health-related knowledge in their networks than those who do not have it. Our findings underscore the importance of considering social network position and the functional specificity of ties in understanding the structural bases of health problems like obesity. We close by discussing implications of these findings for future work on obesity including potential insights into important health disparities.},

To fully describe the influence of dementia caregiving on family caregivers' life, we conducted a systematic review including caregivers' perceptions about the positive and negative aspects of caring and the expressed factors. Materials and methods\enspace{} We conducted a systematic review including articles from January 1998 to July 2020. Qualitative studies reporting family caregivers' perceptions about their experiences and the effects/impact of dementia caregiving were eligible. Two authors extracted the data independently, and the analysis focused on the positive and negative aspects of dementia caregiving in caregivers' life. Results\enspace{} Eighty-\-one studies with 3347 participants were included in this review. The positive aspects of caregiving in caregivers' life encompass personal accomplishment and strengthening relationships, which were enhanced by good medical counselling/formal care support and family/friends support. The negative aspects included emotional and social aspects experienced by caregivers. Other factors such as inappropriate medical/formal care support, illness progression and the costs of dementia contributed to negative appraisal. Discussion and implications\enspace{} The findings provide insights into the holistic experience of caring for a person with dementia revelling the major positive and negative aspects underlying the caregiver role. The evidence emphasises the need `to focus on positive aspects' and targeted interventions aimed at reducing the negative impact of caregiving, which has serious consequences on caregivers' quality of life. A multicomplex intervention for dementia informal caregiving should be developed, committing the society to promote mental health, address these community needs and improve the quality of life of the person with dementia and their family caregivers.},

However, not only is the number of potential informal carers fast decreasing, but also informal caregivers are experiencing a higher caregiver burden. This literature review aims to synthesize the literature on the common determinants of caregiver burden in Western countries, to help ensure future continuation of informal care in the home context, and to improve or sustain the quality of life of caregivers and patients alike. Method: A systematic review of peer-reviewed articles included in PubMed, Scopus, and/or PsychInfo was conducted. Results: Seventeen articles were included. The most important predictors were the duration of caregiving and the patient's dependency level, in terms of both physical and mental dependency stemming from decreased cognitive capacity or behavioural problems. Some specific illnesses and role conflicts or captivity also increased caregiver burden, whereas social support lowered it. Being a female caregiver or having an adult--child relationship led to a higher burden. Conclusions: The most important predictors of caregiver burden are the duration of caregiving and the patient's dependency level. In addition, the patient's behavioural problems and cognitive capacity determine dependency level, and thus care burden. Interventions to relieve burden need to be adapted to the illness trajectory of specific diseases and corresponding needs for social support for both the recipient and the caregiver. Changing role expectations, leading to men being more involved, could reduce the disproportionately high burden for women.},

  abstract = {Social science research on stigma has grown dramatically over the past two decades, particularly in social psychology, where researchers have elucidated the ways in which people construct cognitive categories and link those categories to stereotyped beliefs. In the midst of this growth, the stigma concept has been criticized as being too vaguely defined and individually focused. In response to these criticisms, we define stigma as the co-occurrence of its components--labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination--and further indicate that for stigmatization to occur, power must be exercised. The stigma concept we construct has implications for understanding several core issues in stigma research, ranging from the definition of the concept to the reasons stigma sometimes represents a very persistent predicament in the lives of persons affected by it. Finally, because there are so many stigmatized circumstances and because stigmatizing processes can affect multiple domains of people's lives, stigmatization probably has a dramatic bearing on the distribution of life chances in such areas as earnings, housing, criminal involvement, health, and life itself. It follows that social scientists who are interested in understanding the distribution of such life chances should also be interested in stigma.},

  abstract = {Over the last several decades, epidemiological studies have been enormously successful in identifying risk factors for major diseases. However, most of this research has focused attention on risk factors that are relatively proximal causes of disease such as diet, cholesterol level, exercise and the like. We question the emphasis on such individually-based risk factors and argue that greater attention must be paid to basic social conditions if health reform is to have its maximum effect in the time ahead. There are two reasons for this claim. First we argue that individually-based risk factors must be contextualized, by examining what puts people at risk of risks, if we are to craft effective interventions and improve the nation's health. Second, we argue that social factors such as socioeconomic status and social support are likely "fundamental causes" of disease that, because they embody access to important resources, affect multiple disease outcomes through multiple mechanisms, and consequently maintain an association with disease even when intervening mechanisms change. Without careful attention to these possibilities, we run the risk of imposing individually-based intervention strategies that are ineffective and of missing opportunities to adopt broad-based societal interventions that could produce substantial health benefits for our citizens.},

  abstract = {This book is an "introduction" in two respects: its broad scope and data provide a beginner student with the essentials of anthropology, and it summarizes the accomplishments and methodological inadequacies in that field. The book is not so arranged, but in reality deals with three groups of materials: (1) the first four chapters deal with human and racial origins and the significance of racial (both physical and mental) differences; (2) chapters 7-15 discuss the nature of society and the social and political systems within it; and (3) chapters 6 and 16-26 discuss the characteristic aspects of cultural composition and change. For illustrative facts the author has drawn upon his own field work on the Comanche, Marquesans and Tanala, which are included in an introductory textbook for the first time. Some of the analyses are original, such as the classification of cultural components, from the point of view of individual participation in group life, into universals, specialties and alternatives. Social and political groups are thoroughly discussed, whereas economic life, religion and art are given practically no importance. The problems of culture and cultural change are considered from the point of view of the "schools" of anthropology, the presence of which is regarded as a sign of the science's immaturity. The theories of the diffusionists, functionalists, etc., are impartially analyzed and their inadequacies indicated. Throughout the book, in the last few chapters particularly (on function, interests, orientations, and culture and personality), the need for a psychological approach to anthropology is emphasized.

Methods: An electronic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Health Source Nursing/Academic Edition and Academic Search Complete (ASC) of EBSCO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Google Scholar were searched with a limit of 10 years and published in the English or Chinese language. The paper adopted the framework by Walker and Avant. The attributes, antecedents, consequences and uses of the concept were identified. Results: At total of 33 articles were included. The three attributes of caregiver burden were identified as self-perception, multifaceted strain, and over time. The antecedents included insufficient financial resources, multiple responsibility conflict, lack of social activities. The consequences of caregiver burden resulted in negative change which included decreased care provision, decrease in quality of life, physical and psychological health deterioration. Conclusion: A definition of caregiver burden was developed. Tools to measure caregiver burden were identified. The findings from this analysis can be used in nursing practice, nursing education, research and administration.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore caregiving self-efficacy as a mediator for the association between family functioning and caregiving appraisal of dementia family caregivers in Taiwan. Method: This study adopted a cross-sectional correlational design. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 115 dyads of dementia patients and family caregivers from the outpatient neurological clinics of two hospitals in northern Taiwan. Data were gathered through interviews with a structured questionnaire, which included demographic characteristics for caregivers and patients, family functioning, caregiving self-efficacy, as well as positive and negative aspects of caregiving appraisal. Results: Family functioning, patients' activities of daily living score, Neuropsychiatric Inventory caregiver distress, and three domains of self-efficacy were significantly associated with caregiver burden. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy for obtaining respite (SE-OR) significantly explained 20.5\% of the variance in caregiver esteem. Caregiver perceived worsened health status, family functioning, and SE-OR significantly explained 59\% of the variance in caregiver burden. The mediation test only supported the partially mediating role of SE-OR on the relationship between family functioning and caregiver burden, while the mediating effect of self-efficacy for responding to disruptive behaviours and controlling upsetting thoughts were insignificant. Conclusion: Our findings provided preliminary evidence for health professionals recommending that future studies should assess the family dynamic and health problems of caregivers, and develop appropriate family-centred interventions that focus on strengthening interfamily support and respite services to alleviate caregiver burden.},

Main funding source(s): Center of Excellence for Nursing Scholarship (CECRI), Rome, Italy.Caregiver contribution (CC) to self-care can improve patient outcomes in heart failure (HF). However, caring for a person with HF can be a burdensome experience for caregivers. Experimental studies aimed at improving caregiver self-efficacy and CC to HF self-care are scarce. Moreover, it is underexplored if interventions aiming to improve caregiver self-efficacy and CC to HF self-care consequently affect caregiver anxiety, depression, quality of life and sleep.To evaluate if the delivery of a Motivational Interviewing intervention aimed at improving caregiver self-efficacy and CC to HF self-care affects caregiver anxiety, depression, quality of life, and sleep.Secondary outcome analysis of the MOTIVATE-HF randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited from three centers in Italy, and they were randomized into three arms: Arm 1 (Motivational Interview for patients), Arm 2 (Motivational Interview for patients and caregivers), Arm 3 (standard care). The intervention consisted in one face-to-face MI session, plus three telephone contacts within two months from enrollment with patients (Arm 1) or with patients and caregivers (Arm 2). Data were collected at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, 12 months. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, quality of life was measured with the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and sleep was evaluated with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.A total of 510 patient and caregiver dyads were enrolled. Caregiver median age ranged between 53 and 57, they were mainly female (76\%), married (72\%), spouses (37\%), educated at high school or university level (55\%), employed (73.5\%), and living with the patient (60\%). At baseline, anxiety, depression, quality of life and sleep scores were comparable among the three Arms. Over the year of follow-up, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances decreased, while quality of life slightly increased in all the three Arms. However, these changes were not significant in any of the study arms. When comparing these changes between Arm 2 and Arm 1 and 3, we did not observe any significant difference.Delivering Motivational Interview to caregivers to improve their self-efficacy and contribution towards patient self-care did not increase caregivers' own levels of anxiety and depression and did not decrease their quality of life and sleep. This may help tailoring future interventions for caregivers knowing that such an intervention does not worsen caregivers' conditions and wellbeing.},

She uses ethnography, interviews, statistics, historical and popular culture materials, and medical publications to produce a richly detailed account of Japanese women's lives. The result offers irrefutable evidence that the experience and meanings---even the endocrinological changes---associated with female midlife are far from universal. Rather, Lock argues, they are the product of an ongoing dialectic between culture and local biologies.Japanese focus on middle-aged women as family members, and particularly as caretakers of elderly relatives. They attach relatively little importance to the end of menstruation, seeing it as a natural part of the aging process and not a diseaselike state heralding physical decline and emotional instability. Even the symptoms of midlife are different: Japanese women report few hot flashes, for example, but complain frequently of stiff shoulders.Articulate, passionate, and carefully documented, Lock's study systematically undoes the many preconceptions about aging women in two distinct cultural settings. Because it is rooted in the everyday lives of Japanese women, it also provides an excellent entree to Japanese society as a whole.Aging and menopause are subjects that have been closeted behind our myths, fears, and misconceptions. Margaret Lock's cross-cultural perspective gives us a critical new lens through which to examine our assumptions.},

A total of 206 papers were retrieved and 20 were included. This review showed that a significant proportion of caregivers in Singapore experience caregiver burden. Caregiving experiences and outcomes are affected by cultural, behavioural and socioeconomic factors. Being a Malay caregiver appears to be a protective factor for caregiver burden, whereas having negative coping strategies and care recipients with functional, cognitive and behavioural impairments are positive risk factors. As for outcomes, caregiver burden is associated with poorer self-rated health and reduced quality of life. Multiple instruments have been used to measure caregiver burden, and the Zarit Burden Interview is the most widely used.},

In attempts to address these demands, the present article borrows from the social identity tradition to explain group formation processes in Web 2.0 and other online ecosystems. We propose that online users creatively and strategically exploit the affordances provided by platforms and technologies to construct and perform collective selfhood. We emphasize the relevance of community development, norm consensualization, and emotional alignment as recursive dynamic processes that -- in symbiosis -- provide a functional basis for social identities.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine Medicaid payment trends for insulin products. Cost information is available for all 50 states and has been recorded since the 1990s. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A time-series analysis comparing reimbursements and prices. Using state- and national-level Medicaid data from 1991 to 2014, we identified all patients who used 1 or more of the 16 insulin products that were continuously available in the United States between 2006 and 2014. Insulin products were classified into rapid-acting and long-acting analogs, short-acting, intermediate, and premixed insulins based on American Diabetes Association Guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Inflation-adjusted payments made to pharmacies by Medicaid per 1 mL (100 IU) of insulin in 2014 US dollars. RESULTS Since 1991, Medicaid reimbursement per unit (1 mL) of insulin dispensed has risen steadily. In the 1990s, Medicaid reimbursed pharmacies between \$2.36 and \$4.43 per unit. By 2014, reimbursement for short-acting insulins increased to \$9.64 per unit; intermediate, \$9.22; premixed, \$14.79; and long-acting, \$19.78. Medicaid reimbursement for rapid-acting insulin analogs rose to \$19.81 per unit. The rate of increase in reimbursement was higher for insulins with patent protection (\$0.20 per quarter) than without (\$0.05 per quarter) (P {$<$} .001).Total Medicaid reimbursements peaked at \$407.4 million dollars in quarter 2 of 2014. Total volume peaked at 29.9 million units in quarter 4 of 2005 and was 21.2 million units in quarter 2 of 2014. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Between 1991 and 2014, there was a near-exponential upward trend in Medicaid payments on a per-unit basis for a wide variety of insulin products regardless of formulation, duration of action, and whether the product was patented. Although reimbursements for newer, patent-protected insulin analogs increased at a faster rate than reimbursements for older insulins, payments increased for all products we examined. Our findings suggest a lack of price competition in the United States for this class of medications.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Heavy demands upon dementia caregivers can lead to a number of poor health outcomes including declines in physical, mental, and brain health. Although dementia affects people from all backgrounds, research in the US has largely focused on European American caregivers. This has made providing culturally-competent care more difficult. This study begins to address this issue by empirically examining how culturally-shaped beliefs can influence loneliness in family caregivers of people with dementia. Methods: We conducted a preliminary questionnaire study with Chinese American and European American family caregivers of people with dementia (N=72). Results: Chinese American caregivers were more concerned than European American caregivers about losing face, which in turn, was associated with greater loneliness. This pattern remained when accounting for caregiver gender, age, and relationship to the person with dementia. Conclusions: These preliminary findings highlight the role that cultural beliefs can play in adverse caregiver outcomes, and suggest that addressing concerns about losing face may be an important way for healthcare providers to help reduce loneliness among Chinese American caregivers. Clinical Implications: Understanding how cultural beliefs influence caregiver outcomes is critical as healthcare professionals work to provide culturally-competent care and design culturally-sensitive interventions.},

Caregiving can also be extremely stressful, and many caregivers experience declines in mental health. In this study, we investigated the role that caregiver mental health plays in patient mortality. In 176 patient--caregiver dyads, we found that worse caregiver mental health predicted greater patient mortality even when accounting for key risk factors in patients (i.e., diagnosis, age, sex, dementia severity, and patient mental health). These findings highlight the importance of caring for caregivers as well as patients when attempting to improve patients' lives.},

Methods: a qualitative research, participatory action research, articulated with Paulo Freire's Research Itinerary, developed in April 2018 with family caregivers, in a Stroke Unit. Results: three predominant codes were coded: the need for empowerment and autonomy to experience the care situation; the challenges experienced in becoming a caregiver; and family support. Participants presented a lack of information inherent to the care process, with distancing from empowerment to perform the function in dehospitalization. Dialogue revealed empowerment as a possibility for critical awareness and skill development. Conclusions: it highlights the importance of directing health promotion for caregivers, inserting them in the care process, recognizing their needs and intensifying practices that promote empowerment for care, bypassing curative actions.},

DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a meta-synthesis of three qualitative studies conducted in Massachusetts with 22 African American, Latino, and Chinese caregivers. RESULTS: All participants conveyed striking similarities of thought about normalization of cognitive symptoms until one critical event, usually relocation, precipitated family awareness that an elder's behavior was not the result of "normal aging." A lack of knowledge about Alzheimer's disease, rather than culturally influenced beliefs, was the major deterrent to having an elder's memory assessed. Community physicians' failure to recognize Alzheimer's disease or refer to specialists was more problematic than language or ethnic differences. Physicians' disrespect for caregivers' concerns about memory loss was particularly noted by African Americans, stigmatization of persons with Alzheimer's disease was noted by Chinese, and fears that acculturation would end family home care was noted by Latinos. IMPLICATIONS: Amid ethnocultural differences, there are many similarities in needs that offer providers the possibility to unify quality improvements in Alzheimer's disease outreach, education, and physicians' services. Suggestions include providing the public with more confidential access to Alzheimer's disease information, increasing dementia awareness among community physicians, motivating clinicians to adopt culturally sensitive communication patterns, and providing community education to reduce normalization by families and stigmatization of persons with Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {Major health policy creation or changes, including governmental and private policies affecting health care delivery are based on health care reform(s). Health care reform has been a global issue over the years and the United States has seen proposals for multiple reforms over the years. A successful, health care proposal in the United States with involvement of the federal government was the short-lived establishment of the first system of national medical care in the South. In the 20th century, the United States was influenced by progressivism leading to the initiation of efforts to achieve universal coverage, supported by a Republican presidential candidate, Theodore Roosevelt. In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, included a publicly funded health care program while drafting provisions to Social Security legislation, which was eliminated from the final legislation. Subsequently, multiple proposals were introduced, starting in 1949 with President Harry S Truman who proposed universal health care; the proposal by Lyndon B. Johnson with Social Security Act in 1965 which created Medicare and Medicaid; proposals by Ted Kennedy and President Richard Nixon that promoted variations of universal health care. presidential candidate Jimmy Carter also proposed universal health care. This was followed by an effort by President Bill Clinton and headed by first lady Hillary Clinton in 1993, but was not enacted into law. Finally, the election of President Barack Obama and control of both houses of Congress by the Democrats led to the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often referred to as ``ObamaCare'' was signed into law in March 2010. Since then, the ACA, or Obamacare, has become a centerpiece of political campaigning. The Republicans now control the presidency and both houses of Congress and are attempting to repeal and replace the ACA.},

  abstract = {This review surveys an emergent methodological trend in anthropological research that concerns the adaptation of long-standing modes of ethnographic practices to more complex objects of study. Ethnography moves from its conventional single-site location, contextualized by macro-constructions of a larger social order, such as the capitalist world system, to multiple sites of observation and participation that cross-cut dichotomies such as the "local" and the "global," the "lifeworld" and the "system." Resulting ethnographies are therefore both in and out of the world system. The anxieties to which this methodological shift gives rise are considered in terms of testing the limits of ethnography, attenuating the power of fieldwork, and losing the perspective of the subaltern. The emergence of multi-sited ethnography is located within new spheres of interdisciplinary work, including media studies, science and technology studies, and cultural studies broadly. Several "tracking" strategies that shape multi-sited ethnographic research are considered. The review concludes with observations about the reflexive persona of the ethnographer as "circumstantial activist" in which methodological discussions about multi-sited research in anthropology are now being developed.}

  abstract = {The gross inequalities in health that we see within and between countries present a challenge to the world. That there should be a spread of life expectancy of 48 years among countries and 20 years or more within countries is not inevitable. A burgeoning volume of research identifies social factors at the root of much of these inequalities in health. Social determinants are relevant to communicable and non-communicable disease alike. Health status, therefore, should be of concern to policy makers in every sector, not solely those involved in health policy. As a response to this global challenge, WHO is launching a Commission on Social Determinants of Health, which will review the evidence, raise societal debate, and recommend policies with the goal of improving health of the world's most vulnerable people. A major thrust of the Commission is turning public-health knowledge into political action.},

  abstract = {Approximately 1{$\cdot$}5 billion people worldwide live with a physical, mental, sensory, or intellectual disability, about 80\% of which are in low-income and middle-income countries. This Series paper provides a global overview of the prevalence, benefits, and promotion policies for physical activity for people living with disabilities (PLWD). PLWD are 16--62\% less likely to meet physical activity guidelines and are at higher risk of serious health problems related to inactivity than people without disabilities. Meta-analyses have shown that physical activity has beneficial effects on cardiovascular fitness (average standardised mean difference [SMD] 0{$\cdot$}69 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}31--1{$\cdot$}01]), musculoskeletal fitness (0{$\cdot$}59 [0{$\cdot$}31--0{$\cdot$}87]), cardiometabolic risk factors (0{$\cdot$}39 [0{$\cdot$}04--0{$\cdot$}75]), and brain and mental health outcomes (0{$\cdot$}47 [0{$\cdot$}21--0{$\cdot$}73]). These meta-analyses also show that health benefits can be achieved even with less than 150 min of physical activity per week, and suggest that some physical activity is better than none. Meta-analyses of interventions to increase physical activity for PLWD have reported effect sizes ranging from SMD 0{$\cdot$}29 (95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}17--0{$\cdot$}41, k=10) to 1{$\cdot$}00 (0{$\cdot$}46--1{$\cdot$}53, k=10). There is increasing awareness among policy makers of the needs of PLWD for full participation in physical activity. Physical activity action plans worldwide must be adequately resourced, monitored, and enforced to truly advance the fundamental rights of PLWD to fully participate in physical activity.},

It is hard to conceive of understanding any of the major challenges of life without attention to both potential benefits, challenges, hardships, pressures, threats, and losses, the positive and negative emotions that ensue as a result of the appraisal process. The source of the mistake may be the current Zeitgeist in Western culture that emphasizes personal growth, self-actualization, and the enjoyment of high self-esteem in preference to the more stoic virtues of emotional restraint, self-denial and tolerance of adversity. Much of the work done under the banner of positive psychology is of scientific value, but the current authors sense the hand of popular culture as a guiding force. They commence this commentary by linking the issues raised in the lead article to past research on coping and emotional intelligence. The current authors move on to discuss a number of points of convergence and divergence with the ideas expressed in Lazarus's commentary as they relate to (a) research methodology, (b) positive and negative emotional states, and (c) positive and negative affective dispositions.

Users of weight loss apps can also participate in online forums that act as digital self-help groups. These apps also include several features related to game playing or gamification such as avatars, points and virtual awards. Gamification has the aim of strengthening motivation to carry out a (boring) task. We downloaded the 20 most popular free weight loss apps in Google Play. We analysed app descriptions provided by developers, comments about the selected apps in online forums and user reviews. We focused on four of these apps, since they had some special functions. We found that users' risk management was based on a mixed method that combined quantification and gamification, that is, rationality and emotions. Quantification, which includes self-tracking, data analysis and graphic layout, provides the `rational' basis for dietary regimes, while gamification provides the emotional support needed to maintain motivation and continue with the diet. Our analysis provides support for the emotion--risk assemblage theory and the in-between strategy. Our analysis reinforces the importance of emotions in risk management. However, these dieting apps are based on a reductionist approach to obesity and weight loss, as obesity is framed as an individual problem, while weight loss is seen as dependent on individual motivation. Such framing tends to conceal the social determinant of health and the social and political causes of obesity.},

Although it is the process of extending the medical gaze on human conditions, it appears that medicalization cannot be strictly connected to medical imperialism anymore. Other ``engines'' of medicalization are influential: consumers, biotechnology and managed care. The growth of research and theoretical reflections on medicalization has led to the proposal of other parallel concepts like pharmaceuticalization, genetization and biomedicalization. These new theoretical tools could be useful in the analysis of human enhancement. Human enhancement can be considered as the use of biomedical technology to improve performance on a human being who is not in need of a cure: a practice that is increasingly spreading in what might be defined as a ``bionic society''.},

Participants Sample included 125 Alzheimer caregivers and 60 demographically similar older adults with nondemented spouses (i.e., noncaregivers). Measurements We compared caregivers and noncaregivers on stress, coping, and mood outcomes. We also examined antidepressant use within the caregiver sample. An emphasis was placed upon effect size differences, including Cohen's d as well as more clinically meaningful effect sizes. Results Caregivers were significantly more likely to endorse depressive symptoms and to meet clinically significant cutoff for depression (40\% for caregivers; 5\% for noncaregivers). Approximately 25\% of caregivers reported taking antidepressant medication, although 69\% of these continued to experience significant symptoms of depression. Caregivers also utilized fewer positive coping and greater negative coping strategies than noncaregivers. Conclusion The number of caregivers will increase dramatically over the next two decades, and caregivers will likely seek care from primary care providers. We provide an overview of the psychological issues facing caregivers so that effective screening and treatment may be recommended.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the barriers to healthcare access experienced by asylum seekers in France. Based on data from a qualitative analysis involving 52 semi-structured interviews with asylum seekers, it uses critical race theory (CRT) to understand informal obstacles to healthcare access that are not identifiable in the study of national legislation. Our findings are twofold. First, institutional barriers result from the mismatches between administrative procedures to ensure healthcare access and the realworld concrete difficulties that asylum seekers have to face because of their ethnic and national backgrounds. Second, psychological barriers that hinder refugee from requesting and obtaining proper healthcare (mistrust of public authorities, feeling of discrimination) can be more fully explained by considering the experiences of trauma, insecurity, and marginalization that asylum seekers are forced to endure once they depart from their country of origin. From an academic point of view, this study highlights the importance of including subaltern people in considering the migratory phenomenon, in order to uncover the less visible aspects of discriminatory process. From a political point of view, this study calls for the modification of certain aspects of the asylum procedure which are not suited to the concrete situation of asylum seekers.},

  abstract = {Since the earliest days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, talking about the virus has been a key way affected communities have challenged the fear and discrimination directed against them and pressed for urgent medical and political attention. Today, HIV/AIDS is one of the most prolifically and intimately documented of all health conditions, with entrenched infrastructures, practices and technologies e what Vinh-Kim Nguyen has dubbed `confessional technologies' e aimed at encouraging those affected to share their experiences. Among these technologies, we argue, is the semi-structured interview: the principal methodology used in qualitative social science research focused on patient experiences. Taking the performative nature of the research interview as a talking technology seriously has epistemological implications not merely for how we interpret interview data, but also for how we understand the role of research interviews in the enactment of `life with HIV'. This paper focuses on one crucial aspect of this enactment: the contemporary `normalisation' of HIV as `just another' chronic condition e a process taking place at the level of individual subjectivities, social identities, clinical practices and global health policy, and of which social science research is a vital part. Through an analysis of 76 interviews conducted in London (2009e10), we examine tensions in the experiential narratives of individuals living with HIV in which life with the virus is framed as `normal', yet where this `normality' is beset with contradictions and ambiguities. Rather than viewing these as a reflection of resistances to or failures of the enactment of HIV as `normal', we argue that, insofar as these contradictions are generated by the research interview as a distinct `talking technology', they emerge as crucial to the normative (re)production of what counts as `living with HIV' (in the UK) and are an inherent part of the broader performative `normalisation' of the virus.},

  abstract = {High-deductible health plans (HDHPs) are becoming more popular owing to their potential to curb rising health care costs. Relative to traditional health insurance plans, HDHPs involve higher out-of-pocket costs for consumers, which have been associated with lower utilization of health services. We focus specifically on the impact that HDHPs have on the use of preventive services. We critique the current evidence by discussing the benefits and drawbacks of the research designs used to examine this relationship. We also summarize the findings from the most methodologically sophisticated studies. We conclude that the balance of the evidence shows that HDHPs are reducing the use of some preventive service, especially screenings. However, it is not clear if HDHPs affect all preventive services. Additional research is needed to determine why variability in conclusions exists among studies. We describe an agenda for future research that can further inform public health decision makers on the impact of HDHPs on prevention.},

  abstract = {As unpaid family caregiving of older adults becomes increasingly prevalent, it is imperative to understand how family caregivers are socialized and how they understand the caregiving role. This PRISMA-ScR-based scoping review examines the published literature between 1995--2019 on the socialization of potential and current unpaid family caregivers of older adults. Of 4,599 publications identified, 47 were included. Three perspectives of socialization were identified: (1) role acculturation; (2) role negotiation and identification; and (3) specialized role learning. The findings show how socialization involves different contexts (e.g., cultures), imperatives for action (e.g., circumstances), socialization agents (e.g., family), processes (e.g., modeling), and internal (e.g., normalization) and external (e.g., identification) consequences for caregivers. Future research could fruitfully explore how caregivers manage key turning points within the socialization process, disengage from the caregiving role, and negotiate the socialization and individualization processes within diverse cultural and funding contexts.},

  abstract = {People with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) rely on nonprofessional caregivers for the majority of their care. These caregivers are a crucial first line of defense for management of cognitive health problems. Nevertheless, caregivers often report being underprepared and overwhelmed in their role, and numerous linkage problems can undermine coordination with professionals. Research and interventions targeting caregivers often limit their focus to one primary caregiver, typically a spouse or child, but most caregivers enlist secondary caregivers for additional support, including family, friends, and health professionals. Little is known about the prevalence, roles, or health-related consequences of secondary caregivers. To address this gap, we present an exploratory social network analysis of the caregiver networks of community-residing older adults with ADRD. Interviewer-administered surveys were fielded to primary caregivers receiving services at a Memory Disorder Clinic. Results from egocentric network analysis indicate that ADRD patients in this sample had an average of 7.7 network members including a roughly even mix of informal and professional caregivers. Caregiver network structures vary with social and medical context such as the care recipient's degree of functional impairment. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that caregiver networks are associated with care recipients' use of formal services, primary caregiver burden, and primary caregiver mental health. This study fills critical gaps in understanding with regard to the experiences of caregivers for adults with ADRD, a large and fast-growing population of largely uncompensated health care workers. Specifically, this study advances beyond the dyadic level of analysis typical of most caregiving research, examines coordination between informal and professional caregivers, and produces new insights regarding the effects of caregiver networks on caregiving outcomes and use of formal services.},

  abstract = {The adoption of Big Data analytics (BDA) in insurance has proved controversial but there has been little analysis specifying how insurance practices are changing. Is insurance passively subject to the forces of disruptive innovation, moving away from the pooling of risk towards its personalisation or individualisation, and what might that mean in practice? This special theme situates disruptive innovations, particularly the experimental practices of behaviour-based personalisation, in the context of the practice and regulation of contemporary insurance. Our contributors argue that behaviour-based personalisation in insurance has different and broader implications than have yet been appreciated. BDAs are changing how insurance governs risk; how it knows, classifies, manages, prices and sells it, in ways that are more opaque and more extensive than the black boxes of in-car telematics.},

  abstract = {Can data-driven innovations, working across an internet of connected things, personalize health insurance prices? The emergence of self-tracking technologies and their adoption and promotion in health insurance products has been characterized as a threat to solidaristic models of healthcare provision. If individual behaviour rather than group membership were to become the basis of risk assessment, the social, economic and political consequences would be far-reaching. It would disrupt the distributive, solidaristic character that is expressed within all health insurance schemes, even in those nominally designated as private or commercial. Personalized risk pricing is at odds with the infrastructures that presently define, regulate and deliver health insurance. Self-tracking can be readily imagined as an element in an ongoing bio-political redistribution of the burden of responsibility from the state to citizens but it is not clear that such a scenario could be delivered within existing individual private health insurance operational and regulatory infrastructures. In what can be gleaned from publicly available sources discussing pricing experience in the individual markets established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 2010 (ACA), widely known as `Obamacare', it appears unlikely that it can provide the means to personalize price. Using the case of Oscar Health, a technology driven start-up trading in the ACA marketplaces, I explore the concepts, politics and infrastructures at work in health insurance markets.},

  abstract = {Keating, 2001; Kaden \& MacDonald, 1990; MacLean, Cairn, \& Sellick, 1998). Women caring for dying persons at the end-of-life have been identified in the literature as those most likely to experience negative physical and mental health outcomes such as declines in health status, depression and anxiety from caregiver burden (Cranwick, 1997). Family caregivers, who do not have access to palliative services including counselling and bereavement services, such as those in rural areas, are in need of more support than other populations (Wilson et al., 2006). Living in rural/remote areas presents challenges for dying persons and their families, such as reduced and difficult access to needed services (Kelley, Sellick \& Linkewich, 2003; McConigley, Kristjanson \& Nikolette, 2000; Wilson et al., 2009). Additional social and community services are often found only in distant larger communities (Wilson et al., 2006; World Health Organization, 2007). Researchers have noted the paucity of attention to place, particularly rural and 2011). This article contributes to the remedy of this gap; our research study aimed to better understand female provided end-of-life care-giving in rural and remote Ontario communities. In particular, we were interested in the extent to which geography intersects with gender; that is, to what extent (if any) does rural location impact end-of-life care-giving?

  abstract = {Aim: Informal caregivers play a vital role in the care of people with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), yet caregiving is associated with caregivers' burden. The initial objective of the study was to develop a new outcome measure to assess quality of life (QoL) in AD caregivers. Methods: Informal (non-professional) caregivers providing 75\% or more of the care activities for, and living in the same household as, a person with AD were invited to take part in the study. Qualitative interviews (N = 40) were conducted with AD caregivers in the UK and thematic analyses were applied to generate a pool of potential items. A draft questionnaire was produced and adapted for use in Italy, Spain, Germany and the US. In each of the 5 countries, cognitive debriefing interviews (N = 76) were conducted to determine the questionnaire's face and content validity, followed by a postal validation survey (N = 268). The data from these surveys were combined to reduce the number of items and assess the new questionnaire's psychometric properties. Results: Thematic analysis of the UK interview transcripts generated a draft questionnaire, which was successfully translated into each additional language. The items were well accepted and easy to complete. However, reanalysis of the qualitative interview data revealed that spousal and non-spousal caregivers identified different experiences of caregiving. A review of the item pool indicated that items were primarily targeted at spousal caregivers. Therefore, further analyses of the postal survey data included spousal caregivers only (n = 116). The results supported scaling assumptions (e.g., corrected item-total correlations {$\geq$}0.32), targeting (e.g., floor/ceiling effects \&lt;2.5\%), internal consistency ({$\alpha$} {$\geq$}0.93) and test-retest reliability (rs = 0.88) of the new questionnaire, according to classical test theory. Assessment of external construct validity yielded results in accordance with a priori expectations. QoL scores were most strongly related to scores on the emotional reactions sections of the Nottingham Health Profile and the General Well-Being Index. The new questionnaire was found to be capable of detecting meaningful differences between respondents; spousal caregivers had worse QoL when the person with AD was confused (p \&lt;.001), could not be left alone (p \&lt;.001), did not recognize the caregiver (p \&lt;.001), was incontinent (p \&lt;.05), and wandered around the house (p =.01). Conclusions: The Alzheimer's Disease Patient Partners Life Impact Questionnaire (APPLIQue) is a questionnaire specific to spousal caregivers of people with AD. Data support its scaling assumptions and it exhibits excellent psychometric properties according to classical test theory. The questionnaire is recommended for use in intervention studies where the QoL of spousal caregivers is of interest. \copyright{} The Author(s) 2020.},

It argues that the media (the press, broadcasting, the Internet and increasingly peer-to-peer technologies and networks) have a profound significance for the way in which the world is understood by its citizens. It also argues that without a clear understanding of that significance, and without a critique of the way in which the media go about their daily business, we are likely to see an erosion in the capacity of human beings to understand and respect each other, especially those whom they see and hear only in their mediation. In a world of increasing polarisation and demonisation, the media have a powerful role to play. They can reinforce or they can challenge that polarisation. The book proposes that we should think of the global media as a mediapolis, a single space of political and social communication, in which the basis for the relationships between neighbours and strangers can be either constructed or destroyed. The mediapolis is a moral space, a space of hospitality, responsibility, obligation and judgement. And questioning its present and future requires attention to issues of media justice, media literacy and media regulation. Media and Morality is essential reading for all students and scholars of the media but will be of equal fascination to anyone interested in the workings of our modern world.},

Within these distinct types of culture emerge two forms of stress experience, including a dominant form, consistent with medical ideology, and a marginalized form, consistent with social work ideology. Some surprising patterns of interpretation emerge, including interpretations of ambiguity and burnout as normal, social, and desirable when the social work ideology is dominant.

  abstract = {[This article argues that squadrismo represented a central feature in the ideology and politics of Fascist Italy, influencing the whole period of the dictatorship. In the second half of the twenties, many squadristi became political prisoners, accused of being 'bad Fascists': it looked like the end of squadrismo. Despite punishments and (brief) periods of imprisonment, the squadristi actually continued to play an important part in the fasdstisation of Italian society, in particular during the intransigent 1930s. By disdplining the blackshirts while continuing to make use of their particular skills, Fascism hoped to 'tame the revolution'. Cet article montre que le squadrismo constitue un \'el\'ement incontournable de l'id\'eologie et de la politique de l'Italie fasciste, dont l'influence a perdur\'e tout au long de la p\'eriode de la dictature. Dans la seconde moiti\'e des ann\'ees vingt, de nombreux squadristi ont \'et\'e accus\'es d'\^etre de 'mauvais fascistes' et sont devenus des prisonniers politiques: le squadrismo semblait donc enterr\'e. Mais malgr\'e des sanctions et de (br\`eves) p\'eriodes de prison, les squadristi ont en fait continu\'e de jouer un r\^ole d\'eterminant dans la fascisation de la soci\'et\'e italienne, notamment durant la p\'eriode d'intransigeance des ann\'ees trente. En sanctionnant les chemises noires tout en ayant recours \`a leurs comp\'etences particuli\`eres, le r\'egime fasciste esp\'erait 'dompter la r\'evolution'. Der Autor dieses Beitrags vertritt die These, dass der Squadrismo ein zentraler Bestandteil der faschistischen Ideologie und Politik in Italien war, der die Diktatur w\"ahrend ihrer gesamten Dauer beeinflusste. In der zweiten H\"alfte der zwanziger Jahre wurden viele Squadristi als politische Gefangene inhaftiert und beschuldigt, 'schlechte Faschisten' zu sein: Der Squadrismo schien am Ende zu sein. Trotz Bestrafung und (kurzfristiger) Inhaftierung spielten die Schwarzhemden allerdings bei der Faschistisierung der italienischen Gesellschaft weiterhin eine wichtige Rolle, insbesondere als sich die Fronten in den drei\ss iger Jahren verh\"arteten. Von ihrer Strategie, die Squadristi zu disziplinieren und zugleich deren besondere F\"ahigkeiten weiterhin gezielt f\"ur ihre Zwecke zu nutzen, versprach sich die faschistische Diktatur letztendlich eine 'Z\"ahmung der Revolution'.]},

  abstract = {While discourse about care and caring is well developed in the UK, the nature of knowledge generation about care and the research paradigms that underpin it have been subjected to limited critical reflection and analysis. An overarching synthesis of evidence -- intended to promote debate and facilitate new understandings -- identifies two largely separate bodies of carer-related research. The first body of work -- referred to as Gathering and Evaluating -- provides evidence of the extent of caregiving, who provides care to whom and with what impact; it also focuses on evaluating policy and service efficacy. This type of research tends to dominate public perception about caring, influences the type and extent of policy and support for carers and attracts funding from policy and health-related sources. However, it also tends to be conceptually and theoretically narrow, has limited engagement with carers' perspectives and adopts an atomistic purview on the care-giving landscape. The second body of work -- Conceptualising and Theorising -- explores the conceptual and experiential nature of care and aims to extend thinking and theory about caring. It is concerned with promoting understanding of care as an integral part of human relationships, embedded in the life course, and a product of interdependence and reciprocity. This work conceptualises care as both an activity and a disposition and foregrounds the development of an `ethic of care', thereby providing a perspective within which to recognise both the challenges care-giving may present and the significance of care as a normative activity. It tends to be funded from social science sources and, while strong in capturing carers' experiences, has limited policy and service-related purchase. Much could be gained for citizens, carers and families, and the generation of knowledge advanced, if the two bodies of research were integrated to a greater degree.},

  abstract = {AbstractBackground: Caregiving is a committed role that focuses on providing the required support and care to a care receiver who is either ill, disabled, or dependent to the extent that they are incapable of independent functioning. The topic of caregiving has been extensively studied worldwide, mainly focused on the negative aspects of caregiving, like caregiver stress, burden, role conflicts and burnout among caregivers. However, limited efforts have been made to understand the positive aspects of caregiving among informal caregivers who spend most of their time in this unpaid role. The present study addresses this concern by exploring the positive aspects of caregiving among family caregivers of older persons in India.Methodology: This is a qualitative study, which was conducted, using the existential-phenomenological approach. In this study, a purposive sampling technique was used, and a total of a hundred family caregivers participated from four cities in India, namely Prayagraj, Pune, Visakhapatnam, and Guwahati. Twenty-five family caregivers between the age of 30-50 years participated from each of these four cities. The data was collected using six semi-structured interview questions on positive aspects of caregiving based on the lived experiences of caregivers. The interview schedule was developed based on the PERMA model and finalized after the pilot study. Each interview took 30-50 minutes and was recorded and transcribed. Results: The data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Some commonalities and differences were observed in the responses given by family caregivers from the four cities. Four major themes that emerged for the ``Nature of positive caregiving'' among participants from all four cities are ``Caregiver's attitude,'' ``Care and compassion,'' ``Roles and responsibilities,'' and ``Beliefs and values.'' Four significant themes for the ``Factors contributing to positive caregiving'' are ``Meaningfulness in life,'' ``Sense of belongingness,'' ``Personal growth,'' and ``Empathetic understanding.''Conclusion: Based on the study's findings, it can be said that the themes were associated with the PERMA model. Positive caregiving is an important indicator of caregivers' and care receivers' well-being. The findings have implications for planning some action research, training, and counseling programs for promoting positive aspects of caregiving among informal caregivers.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Despite concerted actions to streamline care transitions, the journey from hospital to home remains hazardous for patients and caregivers. Remarkably little is known about the patient and caregiver experience during care transitions, the services they need, or the outcomes they value. The aims of this study were to (1) describe patient and caregiver experiences during care transitions and (2) characterize patient and caregiver desired outcomes of care transitions and the health services associated with them. METHODS We interviewed 138 patients and 110 family caregivers recruited from 6 health networks across the United States. We conducted 34 homogenous focus groups (103 patients, 65 caregivers) and 80 key informant interviews (35 patients, 45 caregivers). Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using principles of grounded theory to identify themes and the relationship between them. RESULTS Patients and caregivers identified 3 desired outcomes of care transition services: (1) to feel cared for and cared about by medical providers, (2) to have unambiguous accountability from the health care system, and (3) to feel prepared and capable of implementing care plans. Five care transition services or provider behaviors were linked to achieving these outcomes: (1) using empathic language and gestures, (2) anticipating the patient's needs to support self-care at home, (3) collaborative discharge planning, (4) providing actionable information, and (5) providing uninterrupted care with minimal handoffs. CONCLUSIONS Clear accountability, care continuity, and caring attitudes across the care continuum are important outcomes for patients and caregivers. When these outcomes are achieved, care is perceived as excellent and trustworthy. Otherwise, the care transition is experienced as transactional and unsafe, and leaves patients and caregivers feeling abandoned by the health care system.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a counseling and support intervention for spouse caregivers in delaying time to nursing home placement of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), and identify the mechanisms through which the intervention accomplished this goal. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of an enhanced counseling and support intervention compared to usual care. Participants were a referred volunteer sample of 406 spouse caregivers of community-dwelling patients who had enrolled in the study over a 9.5-year period. The intervention consisted of six sessions of individual and family counseling, support group participation, and continuous availability of ad hoc telephone counseling. Structured questionnaires were administered at baseline and at regular follow-up intervals, every 4 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test the effects of the intervention on the time to nursing home placement for the patients after controlling for multiple time-invariant and time-dependent predictors of placement. RESULTS: Patients whose spouses received the intervention experienced a 28.3\% reduction in the rate of nursing home placement compared with usual care controls (hazard ratio = 0.717 after covariate adjustment, p = 0.025). The difference in model-predicted median time to placement was 557 days. Improvements in caregivers' satisfaction with social support, response to patient behavior problems, and symptoms of depression collectively accounted for 61.2\% of the intervention's beneficial impact on placement. CONCLUSION: Greater access to effective programs of counseling and support could yield considerable benefits for caregivers, patients with Alzheimer disease, and society.},

The multivariate linear regression analysis of the effects of perceived social support, personality, and gender on caregiver health explained 28\% of the variance and was highly significant. Higher levels of perceived social support were significantly and independently associated with better health, whereas higher levels of neuroticism were significantly and independently associated with worse health.

In this article, I argue that certain tendencies have become entrenched in our dominant paradigm that leave many researchers pursuing coarse-grained analyses of how difference relates to inequality. Centrally, despite the importance of categories and categorization for how researchers study social inequality, contemporary (as opposed to classical) theories of categories are poorly integrated into conventional research. I contend that the widespread and often unquestioned use of state categories as categories of analysis reinforces these tendencies. Using research on colorism as an inspiration, I highlight several components of what I call the infracategorical model of inequality, which urges researchers to disaggregate difference by shifting our focus from membership in (nominal) categories to the cues of categories, membership in subcategories, and perceived typicality.},

With this in mind, in this chapter we investigate the `new normalities' of life in lockdown. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with a population of childless, highly educated young adults living in northern Italy. Participants report mixed feelings and experiences associated with being locked in their homes: cosiness alongside restriction; the freedom to call friends combined with forced physical isolation; the need to do work in places usually devoted to relaxing. Being forced to stay at home is also a cognitively ambiguous situation, in which people feel themselves to be `in-waiting'. In practical terms, the participants coped with this uncertainty by creating and adhering to rigid routines and new habits. We analyse the participants' `definition of their situation' in terms of the Freudian concept of the Unhemlich (the uncanny, but also the `unhomely'). The uncanny refers to the psychological experience of something as strangely familiar. It describes situations where something familiar appears in an unsettling context. Our hope is that this analysis will inform future research on the effects of the lockdown on mental health.},

Providing care for more than one family member or close other across adulthood is becoming increasingly common, yet little is known about the ways that caregiving experiences shape caregiver preparedness. The current study presents a grounded theory of future caregiver preparedness in former caregivers of PLWD. Method A coding team (five coders and two auditors) used Consensual Qualitative Research and grounded theory techniques to analyze transcripts from 32 semi-structured interviews with midlife former caregivers of parents who died following advanced Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Results Qualitative analysis revealed two dimensions of future caregiver preparedness: caregiving confidence and caregiving insights. Narratives from caregiving experiences informed participants' descriptions of their future caregiver preparedness. Though some former caregivers described a positive (i.e., boosted or sustained) sense of caregiving confidence following care for their parents, others described a diminished (i.e., restricted or impeded) sense of confidence. Regardless of their confidence, all caregivers described specific caregiving insights related to one or more categories (i.e., caregiving self-conduct, care systems and resources, and relating with a care partner). Conclusions Preparedness for future caregiving following recent care for a PLWD varies: For some, past experiences appear to offer cumulative advantages in anticipating future care roles, whereas for others, past experiences may contribute to apprehension towards, or rejection of, future care roles. Entering new caregiving roles with diminished confidence may have negative consequences for caregivers' and care partners' wellbeing. Multidimensional assessment of future caregiver preparedness in former caregivers of PLWD may support development of resources for former caregivers entering new caregiving roles.},

This study aims to analyse the relationships between perceived social support and mental health status in elderly caregivers aged 65 and older. Methods: a cross-sectional study based on data from the Spanish National Health Survey (ENSE-17) carried out on 7023 people. The study population was restricted to 431 caregivers aged {$\geq$}65 years. A study of the correlation between the mental health state and the perceived social support was carried out. Both variables were related to the sex of the caregiver. Results: Perceived social support by older caregivers is significantly related to mental health (p = 0.001), and stress (p {$<$} 0.001). Also, there is a significant relationship between perceived social support and mental well-being (p = 0.001), self-esteem (p = 0.005) and stress (p = 0.001) in older women caregivers. Conclusions: Older caregivers have adequate mental well-being and perceive high social support. Perceived social support can contribute to improving the mental well-being of older caregivers.},

Despite the ubiquity of these technologies, their infiltration into popular sociological research methods is still limited compared to the insatiable uptake of online scholarly research portals. This article argues that social researchers cannot afford to continue this trend. Building upon pioneering work in `digital ethnography', I critically examine the possibilities and problems of four new technologies --- online questionnaires, digital video, social networking websites, and blogs --- and their potential impacts on the research relationship. The article concludes that a balanced combination of physical and digital ethnography not only gives researchers a larger and more exciting array of methods, but also enables them to demarginalize the voice of respondents. However, access to these technologies remains stratified by class, race, and gender of both researchers and respondents.},

A systematic review of literature published from 1980 to 2009 identified: differences in caregiving experiences of African American, Latino, and Chinese American caregivers; psychosocial support interventions in these groups; and cultural tailoring of interventions. Ethnic differences in caregiving occurred at multiple levels (intrapersonal, interpersonal, environmental) and in multiple domains (psychosocial health, life satisfaction, caregiving appraisals, spirituality, coping, self-efficacy, physical functioning, social support, filial responsibility, familism, views toward elders, use of formal services and health care). Only 18 of 47 intervention articles reported outcomes by caregiver ethnicity. Only 11 reported cultural tailoring; 8 were from the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH) initiative. Cultural tailoring addressed familism, language, literacy, protecting elders, and logistical barriers. Results suggest that more caregiver intervention studies evaluating systematically the benefits of cultural tailoring are needed.},

The losses inherent to caregiving itself can be difficult to reconcile after the death of a person with dementia, causing challenges in the bereavement stage. Although there is often significant social support to help people process the death of someone close to them, clinicians can struggle to help bereaved dementia caregivers integrate their ambiguous losses from caregiving, such as loss of roles, functions, and relationships, into a postdeath bereavement process. Many socioeconomic, personality, and family functioning factors impact an individual caregiver's experience, and there are more global influences from the nature of dementia caregiving itself that must be understood to best support a caregiver. Using the lens of the dementia grief model and examples from a case study, this article seeks to illustrate the dynamics inherent in integrating ambiguous losses following the death of a person from dementia, and it proposes clinical goals for working effectively with this population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: With an aging population and public policies that limit accessible and affordable formal care services, informal caregivers, largely women, will continue bearing the overwhelming responsibility for home and long-term care services provision. OBJECTIVES: This study examined gender differences among informal caregivers in caregiving activities, intensity, challenges, and coping strategies and assessed the differential effects of caregiving on their physical and emotional well-being. RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional study conducted between May and September 1998. SUBJECTS: Telephone interviews were conducted with a randomly selected, nationally representative sample of 1002 informal caregivers. MEASURES: Caregivers' sociodemographic, and physical and emotional health characteristics; caregiving type and intensity; formal care support; difficulty with care provision; unmet needs; coping strategies; and the care recipients' health and relationship with caregiver were examined between the genders using descriptive and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Compared with men caregivers, women caregivers were significantly more likely to be 65 years of age or older, black, married, better educated, unemployed, and primary caregivers; provide more intensive and complex care; have difficulty with care provision and balancing caregiving with other family and employment responsibilities; suffer from poorer emotional health secondary to caregiving; and cope with caregiving responsibilities by forgoing respite participation and engaging in increased religious activities. CONCLUSIONS: Informal caregivers, particularly women, are under considerable stress to provide a large volume of care with little support from formal caregivers. Program planners, policy makers, and formal care providers must act together to provide accessible, affordable, and innovative support services and programs that reduce family caregiving strain.},

  abstract = {Background: Alzheimer disease or related dementias (ADRD) are severe neurological disorders that impair the thinking and memory skills of older adults. Most persons living with dementia receive care at home from their family members or other unpaid informal caregivers; this results in significant mental, physical, and financial challenges for these caregivers. To combat these challenges, many informal ADRD caregivers seek social support in online environments. Although research examining online caregiving discussions is growing, few investigations have distinguished caregivers according to their kin relationships with persons living with dementias. Various studies have suggested that caregivers in different relationships experience distinct caregiving challenges and support needs. Objective: This study aims to examine and compare the online behaviors of adult-child and spousal caregivers, the 2 largest groups of informal ADRD caregivers, in an open online community. Methods: We collected posts from ALZConnected, an online community managed by the Alzheimer's Association. To gain insights into online behaviors, we first applied structural topic modeling to identify topics and topic prevalence between adult-child and spousal caregivers. Next, we applied VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) and LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) to evaluate sentiment changes in the online posts over time for both types of caregivers. We further built machine learning models to distinguish the posts of each caregiver type and evaluated them in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the precision-recall curve. Finally, we applied the best prediction model to compare the temporal trend of relationship-predicting capacities in posts between the 2 types of caregivers. Results: Our analysis showed that the number of posts from both types of caregivers followed a long-tailed distribution, indicating that most caregivers in this online community were infrequent users. In comparison with adult-child caregivers, spousal caregivers tended to be more active in the community, publishing more posts and engaging in discussions on a wider range of caregiving topics. Spousal caregivers also exhibited slower growth in positive emotional communication over time. The best machine learning model for predicting adult-child, spousal, or other caregivers achieved an area under the precision-recall curve of 81.3\%. The subsequent trend analysis showed that it became more difficult to predict adult-child caregiver posts than spousal caregiver posts over time. This suggests that adult-child and spousal caregivers might gradually shift their discussions from questions that are more directly related to their own experiences and needs to questions that are more general and applicable to other types of caregivers. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that it is important for researchers and community organizers to consider the heterogeneity of caregiving experiences and subsequent online behaviors among different types of caregivers when tailoring online peer support to meet the specific needs of each caregiver group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few prospective data from the Asia-Pacific region are available relating body mass index (BMI) to the risks of stroke and ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Our objective was to assess the age-, sex-, and region-specific associations of BMI with cardiovascular disease using individual participant data from prospective studies in the Asia-Pacific region. METHODS: Studies were identified from literature searches, proceedings of meetings, and personal communication. All studies had at least 5000 person-years of follow-up. Hazard ratios were calculated from Cox models, stratified by sex and cohort, and adjusted for age at risk and smoking. The first 3 years of follow-up were excluded in order to reduce confounding due to disease at baseline. RESULTS: A total of 33 cohort studies, including 310 283 participants, contributed 2 148 354 person-years of follow-up, during which 3332 stroke and 2073 IHD events were observed. There were continuous positive associations between baseline BMI and the risks of ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, and IHD, with each 2 kg/m(2) lower BMI associated a 12\% (95\% CI: 9, 15\%) lower risk of ischaemic stroke, 8\% (95\% CI: 4, 12\%) lower risk in haemorrhagic stroke, and 11\% (95\% CI: 9, 13\%) lower risk of IHD. The strengths of all associations were strongly age dependent, and there was no significant difference between Asian and Australasian cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This overview provides the most reliable estimates to date of the associations between BMI and cardiovascular disease in the Asia-Pacific region, and the first direct comparisons within the region. Continuous relationships of approximately equal strength are evident in both Asian and Australasian populations. These results indicate considerable potential for cardiovascular disease reduction with population-wide lowering of BMI.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) is a collection of disorders involving mental deterioration, which is often quite distressing for the individuals and those caring for them. Online social media platforms have become popular environments for people to share their ADRD caring challenges and experiences. Despite encouraging findings in the literature regarding online support for ADRD caregivers, studies to date have focused only on a single online community about ADRD, which leads to an incomplete picture of the needs of ADRD caregivers. Additionally, the large volume of data from online communities makes it challenging for both researchers and caregivers to efficiently discover discussions about ADRD care. In this paper, we focus on Reddit, an online rating and discussion platform that consists of many communities, or subreddits, and aim to analyze the topic difference regarding ADRD care between ADRD and non-ADRD subreddits. To do so, we first develop a two-stage classification framework to extract posts about ADRD care from the entire Reddit. Then, we apply structured topic modeling to investigate what has been discussed on ADRD care and how such discussions are prevalent in different types of subreddits. Our results show that non-ADRD subreddits contribute 68.5\% of submissions of ADRD care, more than twice as many as ADRD subreddits. Moreover, non-ADRD subreddits are more likely to disclose legal and financial issues, negative relationships and mental health, while ADRD subreddits are more likely to talk about memory loss, sleeping and diet issues, the disease and clinical visits. Our findings suggest that research in this area should look into discussions beyond ADRD communities to gain a comprehensive understanding of ADRD caring experiences and challenges.},

If we rely on conventional economic indicators, can we ever grasp how the world's billions of individuals are really managing?In this powerful critique, Martha Nussbaum argues that our dominant theories of development have given us policies that ignore our most basic human needs for dignity and self-respect. For the past twenty-five years, Nussbaum has been working on an alternate model to assess human development: the Capabilities Approach. She and her colleagues begin with the simplest of questions: What is each person actually able to do and to be? What real opportunities are available to them?The Capabilities Approach to human progress has until now been expounded only in specialized works. Creating Capabilities, however, affords anyone interested in issues of human development a wonderfully lucid account of the structure and practical implications of an alternate model. It demonstrates a path to justice for both humans and nonhumans, weighs its relevance against other philosophical stances, and reveals the value of its universal guidelines even as it acknowledges cultural difference. In our era of unjustifiable inequity, Nussbaum shows how---by attending to the narratives of individuals and grasping the daily impact of policy---we can enable people everywhere to live full and creative lives.},

  abstract = {Proposing a new kind of feminism that is genuinely international, Martha Nussbaum argues for an ethical underpinning to all thought about development planning and public policy, and dramatically moves beyond the abstractions of economists and philosophers to embed thought about justice in the concrete reality of the struggles of poor women. In this book, Nussbaum argues that international political and economic thought must be sensitive to gender difference as a problem of justice, and that feminist thought must begin to focus on the problems of women in the third world. Taking as her point of departure the predicament of poor women in India, she shows how philosophy should undergird basic constitutional principles that should be respected and implemented by all governments, and used as a comparative measure of quality of life across nations. Nussbaum concludes by calling for a new international focus to feminism, and shows through concrete detail how philosophical arguments about justice really do connect with the practical concerns of public policy.

This study investigated the actual conditions of economic activities and the current status of the financial support systems among people with dementia and caregivers. One hundred and five dyads participated in the survey. Each dyad consisted of an older person with Alzheimer's disease and their caregiver. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) were used to evaluate the cognitive functions of people with dementia. The caregivers were asked questions concerning the financial status of the household and their utilization of the financial support systems available to people with dementia. Average monthly care costs significantly increased according to the severity of dementia, while household income and spending incurred no significant changes. People with dementia experienced financial problems (including a large amount of erroneously purchased, unnecessary shopping), even though their assets were informally managed by their caregivers. Financial support systems such as adult guardianship and civil trust systems were rarely known and used. We proposed the propagation of the adult guardianship and civil trust systems and the development of contract guidelines for elderly customers including people with dementia.},

  abstract = {The literature on migrants' integration and wellbeing is ample, but the case of economic-asylum seekers in a protracted asylum application system is yet to receive sufficient attention. The economic-asylum seekers are a unique group who migrate with an economic motive but apply for asylum to achieve economic integration in the host country. We use the aspiration-capability framework and a mixed-method approach: participant observation, focus group discussion, and field survey, to study a group of economic-asylum seekers from Nigeria when they were waiting for their asylum decisions in Italy. We find that they evaluate their wellbeing by reflecting on their premigration aspirations, integration constraints, and capabilities. They report lower life satisfaction compared to their satisfaction in Nigeria, and were affected by several barriers including structural, psychological, economic, and social constraints. Our study generally describes what it is like to live in limbo and frustration, with a limited assurance for a better tomorrow. It gives voice to the economic-asylum seekers and contributes to the integration literature by examining their perceptions of integration constraints.},

  abstract = {Over the last several decades, epidemiological studies have been enormously successful in identifying risk factors for major diseases. However, most of this research has focused attention on risk factors that are relatively proximal causes of disease such as diet, cholesterol level, exercise and the like. We question the emphasis on such individually-based risk factors and argue that greater attention must be paid to basic social conditions if health reform is to have its maximum effect in the time ahead. There are two reasons for this claim. First we argue that individually-based risk factors must be contextualized, by examining what puts people at risk of risks, if we are to craft effective interventions and improve the nation's health. Second, we argue that social factors such as socioeconomic status and social support are likely 'fundamental causes" of disease that, because they embody access to important resources, affect multiple disease outcomes throughmultiple mechanisms, and consequently maintain an association with disease even when intervening mechanisms change. Without careful attention to these possibilities, we run the risk of imposing individually-based intervention strategies that are ineffective and of missing opportunities to adopt broad-based societal interventions that could produce substantial health benefits for our citizen},

  abstract = {Dementia has been understood primarily as a biomedical phenomenon with a trajectory of irrevocable decline related to neurodegenerative changes. However, growing evidence suggests that the performance and behaviour of persons with dementia are not exclusively determined by neuropathology but are also influenced by personal histories, social interactions and social contexts. This evidence shifts attention from the disease process to the need for a more in-depth understanding of the place of personhood in dementia care. Despite its intuitive appeal however, there is limited empirical research grounding this approach to care. This article articulates a framework for organizing research in this area that is based on a critical review and synthesis of research. It encompasses three interrelated and intersecting domains of inquiry: the subjective experience of the person with dementia, the immediate interactional environment and the broader socio-cultural context. Each domain encapsulates a unique but interrelated dimension of a person-centred approach to dementia care.},

Although he never published a book on the state, in the late 1970s Foucault examined the technologies of power used to regulate society and the ingenious recasting of power and agency that he saw as both consequence and condition of their operation.These twelve essays provide a critical introduction to Foucault's work on politics, exploring its relevance to past and current thinking about liberal and neo-liberal forms of government. Moving away from the great texts of liberal political philosophy, this book looks closely at the technical means with which the ideals of liberal political rationalities have been put into practice in such areas as schools, welfare, and the insurance industry.This fresh approach to one of the seminal thinkers of the twentieth century is essential reading for anyone interested in social and cultural theory, sociology, and politics.},

  abstract = {Conceptually and methodologically, medical anthropology is well-positioned to support a ``bigtent'' research agenda on health and society. It fosters approaches to social and structural models of health and wellbeing in ways that are critically reflective, cross-cultural, people-centered, and transdisciplinary. In this review article, we showcase these four main characteristics of the field, as featured in Social Science \& Medicine over the last fifty years, highlighting their relevance for an international and interdisciplinary readership. First, the practice of critical inquiry in ethnographies of health offers a deep appreciation of sociocultural viewpoints when recording and interpreting lived experiences and contested social worlds. Second, medical anthropology champions cross-cultural breadth: it makes explicit local understandings of health experiences across different settings, using a fine-grained, comparative approach to develop a stronger global platform for the analysis of health-related concerns. Third, in offering people-centered views of the world, anthropology extends the reach of critical enquiry to the lived experiences of hard-toreach population groups, their structural vulnerabilities, and social agency. Finally, in developing research at the nexus of cultures, societies, biologies, and health, medical anthropologists generate new, transdisciplinary conversations on the body, mind, person, community, environment, prevention, and therapy. As featured in this journal, scholarly contributions in medical anthropology seek to debate human health and wellbeing from many angles, pushing forward methodology, social theory, and health-related practice.},

  abstract = {Background. Research, practice, and policy have focused on educating family caregivers to sustain care but failed to equip healthcare providers to effectively support family caregivers. Family physicians are well-positioned to care for family caregivers. Methods. We adopted an interpretive description design to explore family physicians and primary care team members' perceptions of their current and recommended practices for supporting family caregivers. We conducted focus groups with family physicians and their primary care team members. Results. Ten physicians and 42 team members participated. We identified three major themes. ``Family physicians and primary care teams can be a valuable source of support for family caregivers'' highlighted these primary care team members' broad recognition of the need to support family caregiver's health. ``What stands in the way'' spoke to the barriers in current practices that precluded supporting family caregivers. Primary care teams recommended, ``A structured approach may be a way forward.'' Conclusion. A plethora of research and policy documents recommend proactive, consistent support for family caregivers, yet comprehensive caregiver support policy remains elusive. The continuity of care makes primary care an ideal setting to support family caregivers. Now policy-makers must develop consistent protocols to assess, and care for family caregivers in primary care.},

For each, we detail the rationale for its development and explain how to score, analyze, and interpret results. METHOD: NSHAP developed its measures by modifying traditional short-form scales to improve response efficiency and reduce respondent burden. Scoring protocols and interpretations were developed for each measure. U.S. population estimates for older adults born between 1920 and 1947 were generated using age-eligible samples from Waves 1 and 2. RESULTS: NSHAP's protocols yielded U.S. prevalence rates similar to other nationally representative studies of older adults and comparable between waves. Higher estimates of anxiety symptoms and perceived stress in Wave 2 compared with Wave 1 were explained by age, administration mode, and time period. Analytic strategies for longitudinal analyses are provided. In Wave 2, mental health generally was worse at older ages, with women having more symptoms at younger ages than men. Women had fewer anxiety symptoms at the oldest ages. DISCUSSION: NSHAP's mental health measures were successfully integrated into the project's survey and showed acceptable external reliability as well as moderately stable individual characteristics across the 5 years between Waves 1 and 2. Depressive symptoms and unhappiness may form a mental health cluster in the elderly, distinct from anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and felt loneliness. Gender differences in age-specific patterns of mental health were evident using the exact age of participants rather than the traditional decade groupings. Administration mode and time period (between 2005-2006 and 2010-2011) were determined to be potential confounds that need to be accommodated in longitudinal analyses of aging, whereas sample composition was not an issue for interpreting mental health measures.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a critical overview of current concepts and analytic practices in stress research and considers how they can be changed to make the research more consistent with core sociological interests. An overarching concern of the paper is the analytic use of basic information about people's social and institutional affiliations and statuses. It is important that such information be treated not simply as data that need to be controlled statistically; we must examine the bearing of these data on each domain of the stress process: the exposure to and meaning of stressors, access to stress mediators, and the psychological, physical, and behavioral manifestations of stress. The conceptualization and measurement of stressors should move away from their focus on particular events or chronic strains and should seek instead to observe and assess over time constellations of stressors made up of both events and strains. Moreover, the effects of the mediators--coping and social support--are evaluated most fruitfully in terms of their effects in limiting the number, severity, and diffusion of stressors in these constellations. Finally, sociological stress researchers should not be bound to outcomes that better serve the intellectual interests of those who work with biomedical and epidemiological models of stress, nor should the research be committed exclusively to a single outcome.},

  abstract = {Coupled with aging, chronic stress experienced by dementia caregivers often leads to deteriorating health. Comparing caregivers and non-caregivers, we tested whether depression and loneliness mediate the relationship between caregiver status and a measure of chronic stress, the Perceived Stress Scale. Seventy-six cognitively normal older adults (mean age 72.7) were identified as caregivers or non-caregivers based on the functional independence of a paired family member. Caregivers reported more perceived stress, depression, and loneliness than non-caregivers. Using multiple mediation analyses, we found that loneliness and depression mediated the relationship of caregiver status with perceived stress. The loneliness effect on perceived stress was both direct and via its relationship with depressive symptoms. The findings suggest loneliness as a likely point of intervention to reduce caregiver stress. Initiatives to enable caregivers to maintain or develop social relationships apart from caregiver responsibilities may mitigate stress and its negative impact on mental and physical health.},

As in all the European countries, the demand for informal cares is further increased as a result of the ageing societies and the social and political fallout of informal caregiving is a very current and important issue. We have overviewed some international scientific literature, with the aim of understanding the key research objectives to be firstly pursued to address this problem. In particular, we focused on the psycho-physical health differences in informal caregivers, subjected to long lasting load and prolonged stress, as compared to non caregiver persons. We also underlined the relationship between caregiver health differences and stress, gender type, kind of the care recipient (autism) and social and political situation in Europe and Italy. The collected data indicate the necessity to prevent caregiver psychological and physical health by appropriate laws, especially supporting women, often most involved in care activities.},

  abstract = {Link and Phelan (1995) developed the theory of fundamental causes to explain why the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and mortality has persisted despite radical changes in the diseases and risk factors that are presumed to explain it. They proposed that the enduring association results because SES embodies an array of resources, such as money, knowledge, prestige, power, and beneficial social connections that protect health no matter what mechanisms are relevant at any given time. In this article, we explicate the theory, review key findings, discuss refinements and limits to the theory, and discuss implications for health policies that might reduce health inequalities. We advocate policies that encourage medical and other health-promoting advances while at the same time breaking or weakening the link between these advances and socioeconomic resources. This can be accomplished either by reducing disparities in socioeconomic resources themselves or by developing interventions that, by their nature, are more equally distributed across SES groups.},

The model posits how the situational context, interactional process, and caregiving burden perceived by the caregiver affect the quality of elder caring. The purpose was to determine the amount of variance explained by the interactional process beyond that explained by the situational context and caregiving burden. Data were collected from 209 elder-caregiver dyads using interviews, observations, and caregiver self-reports. The strongest predictors of caregiving burden were the caregiver's stressful negative life events (situational context) and discrepancy between past and present image of elder (interactional process). The strongest predictors of quality of elder caring were the caregiver's perception of subjective burden and a monitoring role definition on the part of the caregiver (interactional process). \copyright 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Focusing on the relationship between modern literature and the publishing industry, the volume enables students and academics to extend the text-based framework of modules on contemporary writing into detailed expositions of the culture and industry which bring these texts into existence; it brings economic considerations into line alongside creative issues, and examines how employing marketing strategies are utilized to promote and sell books. Sections cover: The standard university-course specifications of contemporary writing, offering an extensive picture of the social, economic, and cultural contexts of these literary genres The impact and status of non-literary writing, and how this compares with certain literary genres as an index to contemporary culture and a reflection of the state of the publishing industry The practicalities and conventions of the publishing industry Contextual aspects of literary culture and the book industry, visiting the broader spheres of publishing, promotion, bookselling and literary culture Carefully linked chapters allow readers to tie key elements of the publishing industry to the particular demands and features of contemporary literary genres and writing, offering a detailed guide to the ways in which the three core areas of culture, economics and pragmatics intersect in the world of publishing. Further to being a valuable resource for those studying English or Creative Writing, the volume is a key text for degrees in which Publishing is a component, and is relevant to those aspects of Media Studies that look at interactions between the media and literature/publishing"--},

Drawing on theory and research across a range of subjects, from business and sociology to neuroscience and psychology, and from interviews with industry professionals, Phillips investigates how the fundamentals of the book industry are changing in a world of ebooks, self-publishing, and emerging business models. Useful comparisons are also made with other media industries which have undergone rapid change, such as music and newspapers.

Enhancing caregiver self-efficacy has the potential to mitigate these negative impacts, yet little is known about its relationship with other aspects of caregiving. This study examined the relationship between self-efficacy and outcomes; identified factors associated with self-efficacy; examined the mediating role of self-efficacy; and analyzed whether there were racial/ethnic differences. METHODS: Data from caregivers (N\,=\,243) were collected from the Caring for the Caregiver Network study. Participants' level of self-efficacy, depression, burden, and positive aspects of caregiving was assessed using validated measures. RESULTS: Two self-efficacy subscales predicted caregiver depression, burden, and positive aspects of caregiving. Being White, a spouse, or having a larger social network predicted lower self-efficacy for obtaining respite. Higher income and lower preparedness predicted lower self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts and responding to disruptive behaviors. Self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts mediated the relationship between preparedness and depression along with the relationship between preparedness and burden. Race/ethnicity did not improve model fit. CONCLUSION: Self-efficacy plays an important role in caregiver outcomes. These findings indicate that strategies to improve caregiver self-efficacy should be an integral component of caregiver interventions.},

Objective: We aimed to explore the primary topics of conversation on the social media site Reddit related to AD/ADRD. We then aimed to explore these topics in depth, specifically examining elements of social support and behavioral symptomology discussed by users. Methods: We first generated an unsupervised topic model from 6563 posts made to 2 dementia-specific subreddit forums (r/Alzheimers and r/dementia). Then, we conducted a manual qualitative content analysis of a random subset of these data to further explore salient themes in the corpus. Results: The topic model with the highest overall coherence score (0.38) included 10 topics, including caregiver burden, anxiety, support-seeking, and AD/ADRD behavioral symptomology. Qualitative analyses provided added context, wherein users sought emotional and informational support for many aspects of the care experience, including assistance in making key care-related decisions. Users expressed challenging and complex emotions on Reddit, which may be taboo to express in person. Conclusions: Reddit users seek many different forms of support, including emotional and specific informational support, from others on the internet.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a meta-analysis to integrate the results of 116 empirical studies. RESULTS: Ethnic minority caregivers had a lower socioeconomic status, were younger, were less likely to be a spouse, and more likely to receive informal support. They provided more care than White caregivers and had stronger filial obligations beliefs than White caregivers. Asian-American caregivers, but not African-American and Hispanic caregivers, used less formal support than non-Hispanic White caregivers. Whereas African-American caregivers had lower levels of caregiver burden and depression than White caregivers, we found that Hispanic and Asian-American caregivers were more depressed than their White non-Hispanic peers. However, all groups of ethnic minority caregivers reported worse physical health than Whites. Observed ethnic differences in burden and depression were influenced by study characteristics, such as the type of illness of the care recipient and the representativeness of the sample. IMPLICATIONS: The results suggest that more specific theories are needed to explain differential effects of ethnic minority groups of caregivers. Intervention needs vary, in part, between ethnic groups of caregivers.},

Several studies have stressed that patient-provider communication could be hindered if mediated by technologies, leading to an impoverished relationship. We argue that while remote monitoring leads to a redefinition of the patient-provider relationship, it could also offer the opportunity to develop a more intimate acquaintance not possible via only routine visits. The study is part of a clinical trial aimed at assessing the acceptability of a remote monitoring platform for type 1 diabetes. Drawing on practice-based studies, we focused our analysis on the practice of text message exchange between patients and providers. The 396 conversations were coded with a template analysis, leading to the identification of two main categories: 'knowing the patient' and 'knowing about the patient'. The analysis reveals that the practice of messaging led to the development of a 'digital intimacy', a relationship characterised by a thorough familiarity made possible by electronic devices that extends to face-to-face encounters. Drawing on our case, we argue that remote monitoring can foster greater intimacy between patients and providers, which is made possible by the overall increase in the quantity and quality of communication between patients and providers.},

As a relatively new method in nursing science, the situatedness of photovoice within or alongside various research methodologies in a single study remains in a stage of early development. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the photovoice method as a means to elicit phenomenological data when researching the lived experience. While the foundational bases of phenomenology and photovoice differ substantially, the argument presented in this paper suggests that the photovoice method can be successfully used in phenomenological inquiry provided that significant rigour checks are pursued. This includes reflecting upon the origins and understandings of both methodology and method to promote methodological congruency. Data collection and analysis approaches that contribute to phenomenological inquiry using the photovoice method in addition to rigour and ethical considerations are discussed. The use of data generated from photovoice in phenomenological inquiry may fill a void of understanding furnished by limitations of traditional phenomenological inquiry and of spoken language and can enhance understanding of the lived experience, which may not always be best understood by words alone.},

In this paper we develop three main arguments. First, we suggest that recent developments in social science understanding of the nature and significance of lay knowledge should be more widely recognized within the social sciences themselves. Second, we argue that if public health research, whatever the disciplinary perspective, is to provide an understanding of contemporary health problems that is simultaneously more robust and more holistic, it must incorporate and develop the theoretical and conceptual insights offered by this recent work on lay knowledge and with lay people. Finally, we argue that in order to accomplish this it will be necessary to construct research questions in such a way that the conventional distinctions between science and non-science, and the methodological wrangles associated with this distinction, become marginal to the research process. This will inevitably involve conflicts between members of different professional groups. These conflicts provide the opportunity for open debate on the science and politics of public health research and represent a challenge for the many disciplines involved in this field.},

It distinguishes four sources of social capital and examines their dynamics. Applications of the concept in the sociological literature emphasize its role in social control, in family support, and in benefits mediated by extrafamilial networks. I provide examples of each of these positive functions. Negative consequences of the same processes also deserve attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant examples. Recent writings on social capital have extended the concept from an individual asset to a feature of communities and even nations. The final sections describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations. I argue that, as shorthand for the positive consequences of sociability, social capital has a definite place in sociological theory. However, excessive extensions of the concept may jeopardize its heuristic value.},

Lyotard introduced the term 'postmodernism', which was previously only used by art critics, into philosophy and social sciences, with the following observation: "Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives". Originally written as a report on the influence of technology in exact sciences, commissioned by the Conseil des universit\'es du Qu\'ebec, the book was influential. Lyotard later admitted that he had a "less than limited" knowledge of the science he was to write about, deeming The Postmodern Condition his worst book.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The prevalence of childhood obesity has increased worldwide and various environmental factors have accelerated this trend. Several reports have suggested that food advertising causes childhood obesity. We proposed a review study to evaluate the relationship between TV food advertisements and obesity in children. By searching over electronic databases (including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar), the reference lists of original studies, and reviews using key search terms, 1181 articles were identified. Out of these, only 9 articles met the inclusion and quality criteria. Most of the longitudinal study carried out at the national level have reported a significant association between commercial viewing and BMI in children. The duration of these studies varied between 7 months and 5 years. The children?s TV viewing time was between 1.5 and 3.5 hours per day. Results of the reviewed studies have revealed a controversial attitude about the influence of TV food advertisements on obesity. However, three of four modeling studies indicated an increment in the prevalence of overweight and obesity following exposure to food advertisements. Further interventional and longitude studies are needed to achieve more precise results.},

  abstract = {Some have speculated that the rising prevalence of obesity may explain why the rate of mortality improvement in the United States has declined relative to other wealthy countries. This paper estimates that rising body mass index (BMI) has reduced the annual rate of improvement in US death rates between 1988 and 2011 by more than half a percentage point---equivalent to a 23\% relative reduction in the rate of mortality decline---a large amount by international standards. The increase in BMI has reduced life expectancy at age 40 by 0.9 years in 2011 and accounted for 186,000 excess deaths that year. Rising BMI has prevented the United States from enjoying the full benefits of factors working to improve mortality., Recent studies have described a reduction in the rate of improvement in American mortality. The pace of improvement is also slow by international standards. This paper attempts to identify the extent to which rising body mass index (BMI) is responsible for reductions in the rate of mortality improvement in the United States. The data for this study were obtained from subsequent cohorts of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988--1994; NHANES continuous, 1999--2010) and from the NHANES linked mortality files, which include follow-up into death records through December 2011. The role of BMI was estimated using Cox models comparing mortality trends in the presence and absence of adjustment for maximum lifetime BMI (Max BMI). Introducing Max BMI into a Cox model controlling for age and sex raised the annual rate of mortality decline by 0.54\% (95\% confidence interval 0.45--0.64\%). Results were robust to the inclusion of other variables in the model, to differences in how Max BMI was measured, and to how trends were evaluated. The effect of rising Max BMI is large relative to international mortality trends and to alternative mortality futures simulated by the Social Security Administration. The increase in Max BMI over the period 1988--2011 is estimated to have reduced life expectancy at age 40 by 0.9 years in 2011 (95\% confidence interval 0.7--1.1 years) and accounted for 186,000 excess deaths that year. Rising levels of BMI have prevented the United States from enjoying the full benefits of factors working to improve mortality.},

Third, to call for a re-assessment of what lay people can offer to a democratised and customer-sensitive system of health care and to attempt to draw a boundary around the domain of expertise. In following through on those aims, the author calls upon data derived from three current projects. These latter concern the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in people with Down's syndrome; the development of an outcome measure for people who have suffered a traumatic brain injury; and a study of why older people might reject annual influenza vaccinations.},

In a nationally representative sample, we prospectively explore whether and how having an informal caregiver is associated with older adult overall mortality, and how caregivers' burden and benefits perceptions relate to care recipient mortality.We match six National Health and Aging Trends Study waves (2011--2016) with 2011 National Study of Caregiving data, conducting survival analysis on 7,369 older adults and 1,327 older adult-informal caregiver dyads.Having an informal caregiver is associated with 36\% (p\>\&lt;\>.001) higher mortality risk over 6-year follow-up, adjusting for demographic, economic, and health factors. Older adults whose caregivers perceive only burden have 38\% higher (p\>\&lt;\>.05) mortality risk than those with caregivers reporting neither burden nor benefits. This risk is reduced from 38\% higher to 5\% higher (p\>\&lt;\>.001) for older adults with caregivers reporting benefits alongside burden, compared to those with caregivers reporting neither perception.Having a caregiver may signal impending decline beyond known mortality factors. However, interventions to increase caregivers' benefit perceptions and reduce their burden may decrease mortality risk for older adults with declining health and functional ability.},

METHODS: We estimated people with cognitive impairment using a quasibinomial regression model in 10,342 participants with cognitive test scores. RESULTS: The 2020 US Census-adjusted prevalence of clinical AD was 11.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]~=~10.7-11.9): 10.0\% among non-Hispanic Whites, 14.0\% among Hispanics, and 18.6\% among non-Hispanic Blacks. We estimate that in 2020, 6.07 (95\% CI~=~5.75-6.38) million people were living with clinical AD, which increases to 13.85 (95\% CI~=~12.98-14.74) million in 2060, 423\% higher among Hispanics, 192\% higher among Blacks, and 63\% higher among Whites. However, there are predicted to be more significant increases in later years among those over 85 and women compared to men. DISCUSSION: The number of people with clinical AD will increase as the "baby boom" generation reaches older ages, exerting a strong upward influence on disease burden.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Sedentary time spent with screen media is associated with obesity among children and adults. Obesity has potentially serious health consequences, such as heart disease and diabetes. This Community Guide systematic review examined the effectiveness and economic efficiency of behavioral interventions aimed at reducing recreational (i.e., neither school- nor work-related) sedentary screen time, as measured by screen time, physical activity, diet, and weight-related outcomes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: For this review, an earlier ("original") review (search period, 1966 through July 2007) was combined with updated evidence (search period, April 2007 through June 2013) to assess effectiveness of behavioral interventions aimed at reducing recreational sedentary screen time. Existing Community Guide systematic review methods were used. Analyses were conducted in 2013-2014. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The review included 49 studies. Two types of behavioral interventions were evaluated that either (1) focus on reducing recreational sedentary screen time only (12 studies); or (2) focus equally on reducing recreational sedentary screen time and improving physical activity or diet (37 studies). Most studies targeted children aged {$\leq$}13 years. Children's composite screen time (TV viewing plus other forms of recreational sedentary screen time) decreased 26.4 (interquartile interval= -74.4, -12.0) minutes/day and obesity prevalence decreased 2.3 (interquartile interval= -4.5, -1.2) percentage points versus a comparison group. Improvements in physical activity and diet were reported. Three study arms among adults found composite screen time decreased by 130.2 minutes/day. CONCLUSIONS: Among children, these interventions demonstrated reduced screen time, increased physical activity, and improved diet- and weight-related outcomes. More research is needed among adolescents and adults.},

  abstract = {Background and aims: Although female family caregivers, especially those who belong to the sandwich generation, are at the forefront of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) battle, little is known about their experiences. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the female sandwich generation's experiences of multigenerational caregiving under the COVID-19 pandemic in Shiraz located in the southwest of Iran. Methods: Situational analysis (SA) was used as a methodological approach. It is a constructivist grounded theory (GT) developed by Adele Clark as one of the innovative extensions of the GT. In the current study, the multigenerational caregiving by the female sandwich generation under the COVID-19 pandemic is identified as ``the situation'' which is the key unit of analysis and the salient and diverse elements of this situation (e.g., the major human, non-human, discursive, cultural, political, and other elements) were laid out by the messy and ordered maps. In addition, each element on the messy map was analyzed in relation to all other elements, and the nature of the relations among them was examined by the relational map. These maps are derived from qualitative data including the ethnographic observations, discourse materials, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 10 middle-aged female double caregivers of both dependent children and the elderly above 70 years old within the family. Three sampling methods were used across the full trajectory of the research, including purposeful, snowball, and theoretical sampling. Results: The analysis of the multigenerational caregiving situation showed that this situation consists of 95 elements classified under 15 categories and 2 situational maps, along with 2 relational maps that have been drawn from the qualitative data analysis. Based on the organized situational map, this situation occurred as a result of the power of the main discourses, as well as the existing cultural, traditional, and religious elements, and continues after interconnecting to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The first relational map displayed caregivers' adopted information and communications technology (ICT) tool-based strategies such as remote caregiving, telehealth, online visiting, and online shopping, along with the voluntarily double quarantine in order to protect the elderly from COVID-19 infection. Finally, the second relational map depicted that emotional exhaustion is rampant among the caregivers influenced by the experiences that are related to the ICT tools and the voluntarily double quarantine. Conclusion: Overall, some strategies are suggested concerning the necessity of maintaining the mental and physical health of double caregivers and reduction of the negative consequences of the pandemic in them. They include accessibility of ICT tool-based strategies to all, the alternative approaches to severe social isolation, creation of a balance between work-home life and the care demands of two generations, early assessment of the psychological status along with the extensive support by the government, and formal care services to them.},

  abstract = {Goods and resources are finite, and social forces heavily pattern their distribution. One of the principal mechanisms for shaping the distribution of resources is by regulating entitlement to community membership itself. By restricting groups' membership of community, so access to social goods and resources diminishes, which in turn has a negative impact on the health and wellbeing of the excluded groups. It is argued here that community membership is determined on the basis of the perceived social value of groups and individuals and stigmatisation is the marking of individuals and groups who are 'unworthy' of social investment. Using the notion of reciprocity we show how groups may be stigmatised and socially excluded as a mechanism for protecting limited social resources from exploitation. This perspective provides an empirically testable framework for the understanding of stigma and social exclusion that goes beyond the largely descriptive work that currently populates the field. We illustrate the process of stigmatisation and social exclusion and discuss how this suggests new styles of intervention, as well as new directions for research.},

  abstract = {Teaching mindfulness meditation at school has been advocated by educational researchers and practitioners in order to proactively target the well-being of young people. By conceptualizing mindfulness meditation as a technology of the self, in Foucauldian terms, this article considers the ideological implications of implementing mindfulness programs within schools. Recent work by Kristin Barker, it is argued, provides insight into how mindfulness meditation functions as a forceful vector for medicalization. It does so by broadening the scope of illness to encompass the emotional ups and downs inherent to daily life. My thesis is that mindfulness training's medicalizing effect is what transforms this otherwise health-beneficial meditative technique into a non-obvious means for reconstructing the educational subject in line with neoliberalism's ideological dictates. Learning to become mindful is one way members of the younger generation become charged with a moral responsibility to augment their own emotional well-being. The capacity for personal prevention and self-surveillance that school-based mindfulness training inculcates in the young, in turn, is central to the self-managing figure that neoliberalism prizes. When institutionalized as a form of therapeutic education, therefore, mindfulness meditation is not ideologically neutral but rather morphs into a neoliberal self-technology.},

DESIGN: Nationally representative surveys of community-dwelling older adults and their family caregivers residing in the United States. SETTING: 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study and National Study of Caregiving. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults and their family caregivers. MEASUREMENTS: Caregiver burden, comprising emotional, physical, and financial difficulties associated with caregiving. RESULTS: An estimated 14.9 million caregivers assisted 7.6 million care recipients. More than half of caregivers reported burden related to caregiving. In a multivariable regression model, caregivers who assisted with more activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, health management tasks, and health system logistics were more likely to experience burden, as were female caregivers, adult child caregivers, caregivers in poor health, caregivers with anxiety symptoms, and those using respite care. Dementia was the only care recipient characteristic associated with burden. CONCLUSION: Caregiver characteristics and provision of caregiving tasks determine caregiver burden more than care recipient characteristics. Absence of an association between type of a care recipient's chronic conditions and burden, except for dementia, suggests that the tasks that caregivers who assist older adults with a variety of health conditions undertake shape the experience of caregiving.

With this information, we identify areas of intervention and healthcare system strengthening to provide the basis for future health planning and effective healthcare provision to migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees in the European Union (EU). Methods: 1407 migrants in ten European Union countries (consortium members of the Mig-HealthCare project) were surveyed on general health, mental health, and specific diseases using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to investigate the risk factors on general quality of life for migrants and refugees in the EU. Results: Mean age was 31.9 (\textpm 11.05) years and 889 (63.1\%) participants were males. The majority came from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, and Iran. Having a mental health disorder or a chronic disease such as a heart or respiratory disease was associated with worse general health. On the other hand, having permission to stay in the country of interview and being interviewed in the country of final destination was associated with better general health. Access to health care services was fragmented or unavailable for some interviewees because of linguistic, cultural, or administrative barriers. Conclusions: The management of chronic diseases and mental health conditions in European migrants and refugees is a key priority for health service provision. Further efforts should be made to guarantee healthcare access for migrant and refugee populations.},

The focus of this research was on the care situations of extended family caregivers and the impact of caregiving on their health and well-being. In Study 1, data from the National Study of Caregiving were used to describe the experiences of 107 extended family caregivers. In Study 2, case study techniques elicited additional information about the experiences of 10 extended family caregivers. Collectively, these caregivers provide care with little or no formal support and occasional help from a small informal network. Caregiving affected their physical and emotional health, depending on the strength of the relationship between the caregiver and the person living with dementia and the type of care provided. Findings contribute new knowledge about extended family caregivers and highlight the important role extended family dementia caregivers play and the challenges they face.},

Building on two decades of Science and Technology Studies and feminist work on biological actors such as hormones and genes, we propose a 'cortisol sociology' to push further at this argument. As a 'messenger of stress', cortisol is key to understanding human and non-human health as a biosocial phenomenon. We argue that sociologists should engage with cortisol through critical yet open-minded reading of the relevant science and critical triangulation studies, and by tracking cortisol's movements from science into public worlds of biosensing and self-monitoring.},

One increasingly influential way to think about these concepts is the capability approach, a theoretical framework which was pioneered by the philosopher and economist Amartya Sen in the 1980s.             In this book Ingrid Robeyns orientates readers new to the capability approach through offering an explanation of this framework. Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice also endeavors to resolve historical disputes in the literature and thus will be equally engaging to those familiar with the field. The author offers a novel and illuminating account of how the capability approach can be understood in a variety of academic disciplines and fields of application. Special attention is paid to clarifying misunderstandings that have been caused by different disciplinary assumptions and the interpretive consequences they have for our consideration of the capability approach.             Robeyns argues that respecting the distinction between the general capability approach, and more specific capability theories or applications, helps to clear up confusion and misinterpretation. In addition, the author presents detailed analyses of well-known objections to the capability approach, and also discusses how it relates to other schools of analysis such as theories of justice, human rights, basic needs, and the human development approach.

Reducing this risk and filling the void of culturally responsive interventions for caregivers requires the development of participant informed models of care that promote group strengths such as effective coping. In this pilot study, Black family caregivers (n=30) completed a survey comprised of a demographic questionnaire, various measures of function, self-efficacy, social support, and coping. Study findings point to a well-educated population with underlying health concerns such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes that may be complicated by caregiving stress. Common coping strategies used by participants included spiritual coping (80\%), use of past experiences (80\%), and information gathering (75\%). Clinicians can support dementia family caregivers by promoting spiritual coping and self-care, as well as providing reference resources about respite and managing challenging behaviors. Power analysis suggests a future sample size of 385.},

  abstract = {Obesity is one of the best-documented outcomes of screen media exposure. Many observational studies find relationships between screen media exposure and increased risks of obesity. Randomized controlled trials of reducing screen time in community settings have reduced weight gain in children, demonstrating a cause and effect relationship. Current evidence suggests that screen media exposure leads to obesity in children and adolescents through increased eating while viewing; exposure to high-calorie, low-nutrient food and beverage marketing that influences children's preferences, purchase requests, consumption habits; and reduced sleep duration. Some evidence also suggests promise for using interactive media to improve eating and physical activity behaviors to prevent or reduce obesity. Future interdisciplinary research is needed to examine the effects of newer mobile and other digital media exposures on obesity; to examine the effectiveness of additional interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of media exposures on obesity and possible moderators and mediators of intervention effects; to effectively use digital media interventions to prevent and reduce obesity; and to uncover the mechanisms underlying the causal relationships and interactions between obesity-related outcomes and media content, characteristics, and context.},

  abstract = {Children spend a substantial portion of their lives watching television. Investigators have hypothesized that television viewing causes obesity by one or more of three mechanisms: (1) displacement of physical activity, (2) increased calorie consumption while watching or caused by the effects of advertising, and (3) reduced resting metabolism. The relationship between television viewing and obesity has been examined in a relatively large number of cross-sectional epidemiologic studies but few longitudinal studies. Many of these studies have found relatively weak, positive associations, but others have found no associations or mixed results; however, the weak and variable associations found in these studies may be the result of limitations in measurement. Several experimental studies of reducing television viewing recently have been completed. Most of these studies have not tested directly the effects of reducing television viewing behaviors alone, but their results support the suggestion that reducing television viewing may help to reduce the risk for obesity or help promote weight loss in obese children. Finally, one school-based, experimental study was designed specifically to test directly the causal relationship between television viewing behaviors and body fatness. The results of this randomized, controlled trial provide evidence that television viewing is a cause of increased body fatness and that reducing television viewing is a promising strategy for preventing childhood obesity.},

  abstract = {To date, the role of family members in caring for relatives affected by schizophrenia has focused largely on the negative aspects of impact of the illness. The present study aimed to: (1) assess family functioning and burden of care in caregivers living in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy who looked after subjects affected by chronic schizophrenia; (2) evaluate the relationship between aspects of family functioning and burden of care, in particular personal growth (PG) of caregivers; and (3) identify variables capable of affecting PG of caregivers. A total of 136 caregivers (mean length of illness of family member more than 20 years) were recruited from 9 Italian research sites and evaluated in terms of ``positive'' family functioning--problem-solving, communication skills and personal goals Family Functioning Questionnaire (FFQ), burden of care, and PG Family Problems Questionnaire (FPQ). Caregivers reported an overall good family functioning with a relatively low objective and subjective burden of care. The latter was positively correlated with length of illness, with women showing a higher subjective burden than men. Reduced problem-solving skills and ability of each family member to pursue personal goals were both associated with reduced objective and subjective burden which, conversely, were both increased by inadequate support and scarce positive comments from relatives and friends. Approximately 50\% of caregivers stated that ``they had learned something positive from the situation,'' highlighting a statistically higher proportion of caregivers in southern Italy than in northern and central Italy. Caregivers' PG was associated with good family functioning, adequate professional support, and positive comments. PG also seemed to be positively influenced by support from relatives and friends (O.R. 14.306). The numerous challenges and positive aspects associated with caregiving should be duly acknowledged by mental health services and integrated into routine clinical assessment and intervention framework.},

Nothing could be further from the truth today. In this new intellectual atmosphere, Sociology, Capitalism, Critique is a contribution to the renewal of critical sociology, founded on an empirically grounded diagnosis of society's ills. The authors, Germany's leading critical sociologists---Klaus D\"orre, Stephan Lessenich, and Hartmut Rosa---share a conviction that ours is a pivotal period of renewal, in which the collective endeavour of academics can amount to an act of intellectual resistance, working to prevent any regressive development that might return us to neoliberal domination. The authors discuss key issues, such as questions of accumulation and expropriation; discipline and freedom; and the powerful new concepts of activation and acceleration. Their politically committed sociology, which takes the side of the losers in the current crisis, places society's future well-being at the centre of their research. Their collective approach to this project is a conscious effort to avoid co-optation in the institutional practices of the academy. These three differing but complementary perspectives serve as an insightful introduction to the contemporary themes of radical sociology in capitalism's post-crisis phase.},

The definitive English language article on neurological complications of the antipsychotics was published in 1961, but there was continuing scepticism from many psychiatrists about the reality of this problem and its relation to drugs. Antidepressant medications work by increasing the availability of neurotransmitters or by changing the sensitivity of the receptors for these chemical messengers. Disease, drug and treatment thus each support one another though an account at the level of molecular neuroscience. The best selling drugs these days are not those that treat acute illnesses, but those that are prescribed chronically.},

  abstract = {Considerable research and public discourse on family caregiving portrays it as a stressful and burdensome experience with serious negative health consequences. A landmark study by Schulz and Beach that reported higher mortality rates for strained spouse caregivers has been widely cited as evidence for the physical health risks of caregiving and is often a centerpiece of advocacy for improved caregiver services. However, 5 subsequent population-based studies have found reduced mortality and extended longevity for caregivers as a whole compared with noncaregiving controls. Most caregivers also report benefits from caregiving, and many report little or no caregiving-related strain. Policy reports, media portrayals, and many research reports commonly present an overly dire picture of the health risks associated with caregiving and largely ignore alternative positive findings. As the pool of traditional family caregivers declines in the coming years, a more balanced and updated portrayal of the health effects of caregiving is needed to encourage more persons to take on caregiving roles, and to better target evidence-based services to the subgroup of caregivers who are highly strained or otherwise at risk. Recommendations are discussed for research that will better integrate and clarify both the negative and potential positive health effects of informal caregiving.},

In this study, I examine how older caregivers experience changes in personal network structure. Using two waves from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, I investigate whether caregivers are more or less likely to exhibit bridging or bonding capital potential compared to noncaregivers. I find that older adults transitioning into caregiving are more likely to develop the ability to bridge social ties within their personal networks than noncaregivers despite potential constraints in their personal freedom. Caregivers in the latter stages, meanwhile, do not differ from noncaregivers in terms of network change. These findings have implications for older adults? potential to pool resources across social domains as well as negotiate stress and well-being during the caregiving process.},

  abstract = {Multiple studies have confirmed a seemingly paradoxical finding that family caregivers have lower mortality rates than comparable samples of noncaregivers. Caregivers are often also found to report more symptoms of depression and higher stress levels, but psychological distress and mortality are rarely examined in the same study. This study tests a possible mechanism for the mortality effect by applying a theoretical model that posits psychological and physiological stress-buffering benefits from prosocial helping behaviors. Participants in the population-based REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study included 3,580 family caregivers who were individually matched to 3,580 noncaregivers on 15 demographic, health history, and health behavior variables using a propensity score matching algorithm. Baseline measures of depressive symptoms and perceived stress levels were also collected. The results indicated that caregivers reported significantly more depressive symptoms and higher perceived stress levels than propensity-matched noncaregivers (ps {$<$} .0001). However, consistent with our previous analysis (Roth et al., 2013), an analysis of 7-year survival rates showed that caregivers had a 16.5\% lower mortality rate than noncaregivers (hazard ratio = 0.835, 95\% CI = 0.719, 0.970). Significant caregiving*psychological distress interaction effects supported the stress-buffering hypothesis. Both depressive symptoms and perceived stress scores were significant predictors of mortality for the matched noncaregivers (ps {$<$} .0001), but not for the caregivers (ps {$>$} .49). Family caregiving appears to be similar to other prosocial helping behaviors in that it provides stress-buffering adaptations that ameliorate the impact of stress on major health outcomes such as mortality.

  abstract = {Importance: Caregivers are pivotal in supporting the growing population of people with chronic conditions. Yet, engaging in the caregiver role involves the risk of poor outcomes. Caregiver interventions are needed that address poor outcomes while fostering engagement in role-related activities.Objective: To evaluate the evidence for interventions to support caregivers of adults with chronic conditions.Data Sources: Five databases were searched for studies of interventions for caregivers and patient--caregiver dyads published between 1995 and 2019.Study Selection and Data Collection: We reviewed the titles, abstracts, and full-text articles of the initial search results (N = 12,216 studies) according to a predetermined protocol.Findings: Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Psychoeducation and education with skills training were the two caregiver intervention themes. Studies evaluating psychoeducation (n = 28) provided low strength of evidence for improved psychosocial outcomes. Within this theme, problem-solving and coping skills training were common intervention components associated with significant improvements in depression and quality of life. Studies evaluating education with skills training (n = 20) provided moderate strength of evidence for improved knowledge and low strength of evidence for improved psychosocial outcomes. Dyadic self-management education and hands-on training were common components associated with significant improvements in knowledge, quality of life, and burden or strain.Conclusions and Relevance: We found low strength of evidence to support the use of psychoeducation and education with skills training. Within these approaches, problem-solving and coping skills training, dyadic self-management education, and hands-on training show promise for improving caregiver outcomes.What This Article Adds: Findings of this systematic review are inconclusive with respect to psychoeducation and education with skills training leading to improved caregiver well-being. Within these broad approaches, the findings support the use of problem-solving and coping skills training, dyadic self-management education, and hands-on training to improve knowledge and well-being among caregivers of people with chronic conditions.},

  abstract = {Amidst the climate of crisis surrounding the rise in opioid-related overdose in the USA, early in 2019, Google and Deloitte launched ?Opioid360?. Here came a platform combining browser histories, credit, insurance, social media, and traditional survey data to sell the service of risk calculation in population health. Opioid360's approach to automating risk calculation not only promised to identify persons ?at risk? of opioid dependence, but also paved the way for broader applications anticipating common chronic diseases and coordinating logistical operations involved in pandemic response. Beginning with this experimental platform, this paper develops an analysis of the Big Data mode of risk calculation - an epistemological and political shift that involves technology companies, investors, insurers, governments, and public health institutions. The analysis focuses on the re-emergence of ?social determinants of health? (SDOH) in the rhetoric accompanying novel analytic platforms that estimate, calculate, and compute individual health risks. While the treatment of SDOH has always been a site of political contestation within the discipline of public health, powerful interests are crystallising around the concept and instrumentalising it in platforms that sell algorithmic prediction. Silicon Valley's breed of asset-oriented technoscience appears not only to be amplifying the behaviouralist elements of public health. Among the stakes of the Big Data mode is the paradoxical retreat from changing social conditions that contribute to the prevalence of health and illness in populations; and instead, the promotion of an apparatus for pricing and exchanging individual risk or excluding from services those who bear risk most acutely.},

Method: A twelve-week support group intervention was implemented using a private Facebook group as a platform. Data collection included preinterviews and postinterviews with participants. A thematic analysis of data was conducted and interactions within the group were assessed. Results: Eight caregivers in Alabama enrolled in the program, including African American and rural-dwelling caregivers. Findings indicate that caregivers had a positive experience in the group, found group content relevant and helpful, and were comfortable interacting with others in the group because it was private. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated that private Facebook groups are a feasible way of providing community-based education and support for dementia caregivers. Given their accessibility, wide use, and cost effectiveness, service providers may consider how they may transfer some services to a virtual platform using private Facebook groups to reach caregivers who are at high risk of isolation or have other barriers to accessing in-person services.},

Aspects of well-being derived from this literature (i.e., self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth) were operationalized. Three hundred and twenty-one men and women, divided among young, middle-aged, and older adults, rated themselves on these measures along with six instruments prominent in earlier studies (i.e., affect balance, life satisfaction, self-esteem, morale, locus of control, depression). Results revealed that positive relations with others, autonomy, purpose in life, and personal growth were not strongly tied to prior assessment indexes, thereby supporting the claim that key aspects of positive functioning have not been represented in the empirical arena. Furthermore, age profiles revealed a more differentiated pattern of well-being than is evident in prior research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {BackgroundDepressive symptoms are highly prevalent among partnered dementia caregivers, but the mechanisms are unclear. This study examined the mediating role of loneliness in the association between dementia and other types of care on subsequent depressive symptoms.MethodsProspective data from partnered caregivers were drawn from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging. The sample consisted of 4,672 partnered adults aged 50--70 living in England and Wales, followed up between 2006--2007 and 2014--2015. Caregiving was assessed across waves 3 (2006--2007), 4 (2008--2009), and 5 (2010--2011), loneliness at wave 6 (2012--2013), and subsequent depressive symptoms at wave 7 (2014--15). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between caregiving for dementia and depressive symptoms compared to caregiving for other illnesses (e.g., diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), cancer, and stroke). Binary mediation analysis was used to estimate the indirect effects of caregiving on depressive symptoms via loneliness.ResultsCare for a partner with dementia was associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms at follow-up compared to those not caring for a partner at all (odds ratio [OR]~=~2.6, 95\% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.4, 5.1). This association was partially mediated by loneliness (34\%). Care for a partner with other conditions was also associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms compared to non-caregiving partners (OR~=~1.7, 95\% CI: 1.2, 2.5), but there was no evidence of an indirect pathway via loneliness.ConclusionLoneliness represents an important contributor to the relationship between dementia caregiving and subsequent depressive symptoms; therefore, interventions to reduce loneliness among partnered dementia caregivers should be considered.},

  abstract = {Informal caregivers are increasingly recognised as key providers of care to individuals with long-term conditions. However, caregiving itself is a contested domain and one that is increasingly the object of policy and institutional intervention. A recent development is that of providing formal training to caregivers, to better equip them to carry out what is perceived to be a new and demanding role. A number of such interventions have been developed and evaluated, with mixed results. At the start of a process evaluation of one such intervention, specifically for stroke caregivers, we sought to better understand what implicit model of the caregiver underpins training interventions and how this model might be accounted for. In this article, we aim to address these questions by examining models of the `caregiver' present in different bodies of literature and their relevance for caregiver training. We consider the extent to which this points to the emergence of a normative model of the caregiver. We propose that training caregivers serves to create expert or semi-professional caregivers, through the transmission of technical knowledge and practices from health professional to lay person. We also consider the wider implications this has for informal caregivers and caregiving practices.},

However narrative data can also be used to examine how context influences self-concepts, relationship dynamics, and meaning-making. This methodological paper explores the potential of narrative analysis to discover and compare the processes by which culture shapes selfhood and meaning making. We describe the development of the Comparative Ethnographic Narrative Analysis Method as an analytic procedure to systematically compare narrators? experiences, meaning making, decisions, and actions across cultures. This analytic strategy seeks to discover shared themes, examine culturally distinct themes, and illuminate meta-level cultural beliefs and values that link shared themes. We emphasize the need for a shared research question, comparable samples, shared non-biased instruments, and high-fidelity training if one uses this qualitative method for cross-cultural research. Finally, specific issues, trouble-shooting practices, and implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background Research indicates that social isolation and loneliness increase the risk of mental disorders, but less is known about the distinct contributions of different aspects of isolation. We aimed to distinguish the pathways through which social disconnectedness (eg, small social network, infrequent social interaction) and perceptions of social isolation (eg, loneliness, perceived lack of support) contribute to anxiety and depression symptom severity in community-residing older adults aged 57--85 years at baseline. Methods We did a longitudinal mediation analysis with data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). The study included individuals from the USA born between 1920 and 1947. Validated measures on social disconnectedness, perceived isolation, and depression and anxiety symptoms were used. Structural equation modelling was used to construct complete longitudinal path models. Findings Using data from 3005 adults aged 57--85 years, we identified two significant longitudinal mediation patterns with symptoms of depression, and two with anxiety symptoms. Overall, social disconnectedness predicted higher subsequent perceived isolation ({$\beta$}=0{$\cdot$}09; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), which in turn predicted higher depression symptoms ({$\beta$}=0{$\cdot$}12; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) and anxiety symptoms ({$\beta$}=0{$\cdot$}12; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). The reverse pathways were statistically supported as well, suggesting bi-directional influences. Interpretation Social network structure and function are strongly intertwined with anxiety and depression symptoms in the general population of older adults. Public health initiatives could reduce perceived isolation by facilitating social network integration and participation in community activities, thereby protecting against the development of affective disorders.},

  abstract = {The aim of this article is to articulate the concepts of familialism and defamilialization as well as their indicators to assess whether and how welfare states, or regimes, differ not only in the degree to which they are defamilialized but also in the specific familialism form. In other words, it assesses whether family responsibility in a given area (and its gender dimension) is only assumed without public policy support or, on the contrary, whether it is actively enforced by laws or supported by income transfers and time allocation. The same diversification also exists for the opposite concept, defamilialization, which may happen through positive, direct or indirect policy interventions or because of the lack of such interventions, encouraging recourse to the market. The article shows that when considering these distinctions in the analyses, the profiles of countries that are usually generically described as `familialistic welfare states', such as Italy and Spain in Europe or Japan and Korea in East Asia, and their similarities and differences partly differ from those that emerge when considering only a simplified familialism -- defamilialization dichotomy, in so far both familialism and defamilialization may occur, and be combined, through distinct means, offering, therefore, also different options.},

  abstract = {The concept of stigma, denoting relations of shame, has a long ancestry and has from the earliest times been associated with deviations from the 'normal', including, in various times and places, deviations from normative prescriptions of acceptable states of being for self and others. This paper dwells on modern social formations and offers conceptual and theoretical pointers towards a more convincing contemporary sociology of health-related stigma. It starts with an appreciation and critique of Goffman's benchmark sensitisation and traces his influence on the personal tragedy or deviance paradigm dominant in the medical sociology from the 1970s. To allow for the development of an argument, the focus here is on specific types of disorder--principally, epilepsy and HIV--rather than the research literature as a whole. Brief and critical consideration is given to attempts to operationalise or otherwise 'measure' health-related stigma. The advocacy of a rival oppression paradigm by disability theorists from the 1980s, notably through re-workings of the social model of disability, is addressed. It is suggested that we are now in a position to learn and move on from this paradigm 'clash'. A re-framing of notions of relations of stigma, signalling shame, and relations of deviance, signalling blame, is proposed. This framework, and the positing of a variable and changing dynamic between cultural norms of shame and blame--always embedded in social structures of class, command, gender, ethnicity and so on--is utilised to explore recent approaches to health stigma reduction programmes.},

In this article we advocate the deconstruction of received concepts about the body and begin this process by examining three perspectives from which the body may be viewed: (1) as a phenomenally experienced individual body-self; (2) as a social body, a natural symbol for thinking about relationships among nature, society, and culture; and (3) as a body politic, an artifact of social and political control. After discussing ways in which anthropologists, other social scientists, and people from various cultures have conceptualized the body, we propose the study of emotions as an area of inquiry that holds promise for providing a new approach to the subject.},

Case management for people with dementia is often poorly defined and insufficiently described. The crucial process steps are often not well understood. We aim to map and compare the key components, processes and contextual factors of case management programmes for dementia and to explore aspects of the interventions' generalisability. Our search covered the databases PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane and GeroLit, as well as policy papers from international organisations. We included qualitative, quantitative and mixed-\-methods studies in the English or German language that was published between 1999 and 2020. The programmes were analysed according to programme characteristics, case management intervention and the structural and processing conditions. We identified 67 studies dealing with 25 programmes. Approximately half of the programmes were investigated in randomised controlled trials, two programmes used a mixed-\-methods design and the remaining were the subject of pre-p\- ost cohort studies. Participants in the studies were predominantly dyads of people with dementia and their informal caregivers. About half of the programmes reported a theoretical framework. All the programmes were derived from case management approaches or referred to such approaches. Despite huge differences in implementation, all the programmes covered the case management steps. In 14 out of 25 programmes, case management was carried out without additional intervention, the other programmes provided mainly education and training for informal caregivers. Costs of the case management interventions were stated in more than half of the programmes.The effectiveness and generalisability of dementia-\-specific case management interventions could be enhanced if the framework introduced in the review was used in the future by policy, practice and research.},

  abstract = {SALUTE E SOCIET\`A - Modernity, Stress and the Quest for Emotional Self-management - Sociology has a longstanding tradition in describing the emotional regime of modernity as "disciplining" effect, accompanied by an increased demand for selfregulation (Elias). Recently, researchers stressed that we nowadays observe a growing informalization of emotion rules (Wouters) and an increased demand for the emotional labour (Hochschild). The tension between disciplinary limitation of emotions and their informalization is mirrored in the growing necessity to psychologically and chemically alter and optimize emotions (Neckel). Beyond a mere theoretical analysis of this tension, the article empirically explores the selfperceptions and self-management strategies of young women in Sweden in order to cope with felt oppression and stress in relation to the emotional and behavioural demands of their environment.},

  abstract = {Over the last 5 years, wearable technology -- comprising devices whose embedded sensors and analytic algorithms can track, analyze and guide wearers' behavior -- has increasingly captured the attention of venture capitalists, technology startups, established electronics companies and consumers. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted 2 years running at the Consumer Electronics Show and its Digital Health Summit, this article explores the vision of technologically assisted self-regulation that drives the design of wearable tracking technology. As key artifacts in a new cultural convergence of sensor technology and self-care that I call `data for life', wearables are marketed as digital compasses whose continuous tracking capacities and big-data analytics can help consumers navigate the field of everyday choice making and better control how their bites, sips, steps and minutes of sleep add up to affect their health. By offering consumers a way to simultaneously embrace and outsource the task of lifestyle management, I argue, such products at once exemplify and short-circuit cultural ideals for individual responsibility and self-regulation.},

  abstract = {Objective To examine the relationship between caregiving demands among older spousal caregivers and 4-year all-cause mortality, controlling for sociodemographic factors, prevalent clinical disease, and subclinical disease at baseline. Design Prospective population-based cohort study, from 1993 through 1998 with an average of 4.5 years of follow-up. Setting Four US communities. Participants A total of 392 caregivers and 427 noncaregivers aged 66 to 96 years who were living with their spouses. Main Outcome Measure Four-year mortality, based on level of caregiving: (1) spouse not disabled; (2) spouse disabled and not helping; (3) spouse disabled and helping with no strain reported; or (4) spouse disabled and helping with mental or emotional strain reported. Results After 4 years of follow-up, 103 participants (12.6\%) died. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, prevalent disease, and subclinical cardiovascular disease, participants who were providing care and experiencing caregiver strain had mortality risks that were 63\% higher than noncaregiving controls (relative risk [RR], 1.63; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-2.65). Participants who were providing care but not experiencing strain (RR, 1.08; 95\% CI, 0.61-1.90) and those with a disabled spouse who were not providing care (RR, 1.37; 95\% CI, 0.73-2.58) did not have elevated adjusted mortality rates relative to the noncaregiving controls. Conclusions Our study suggests that being a caregiver who is experiencing mental or emotional strain is an independent risk factor for mortality among elderly spousal caregivers. Caregivers who report strain associated with caregiving are more likely to die than noncaregiving controls.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although family caregiving has been intensively studied in the past decade, little attention has been paid to the impact of end-of-life care on caregivers who are family members of persons with dementia or to the caregivers' responses to the death of the patient. METHODS: Using standardized assessment instruments and structured questions, we assessed the type and intensity of care provided by 217 family caregivers to persons with dementia during the year before the patient's death and assessed the caregivers' responses to the death. RESULTS: Half the caregivers reported spending at least 46 hours per week assisting patients with activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. More than half the caregivers reported that they felt they were "on duty" 24 hours a day, that the patient had frequent pain, and that they had had to end or reduce employment owing to the demands of caregiving. Caregivers exhibited high levels of depressive symptoms while providing care to the relative with dementia, but they showed remarkable resilience after the death. Within three months of the death, caregivers had clinically significant declines in the level of depressive symptoms, and within one year the levels of symptoms were substantially lower than levels reported while they were acting as caregivers. Seventy-two percent of caregivers reported that the death was a relief to them, and more than 90 percent reported belief that it was a relief to the patient. CONCLUSIONS: End-of-life care for patients with dementia was extremely demanding of family caregivers. Intervention and support services were needed most before the patient's death. When death was preceded by a protracted and stressful period of caregiving, caregivers reported considerable relief at the death itself.},

Thousands of published empirical studies and dozens of reviews have documented the psychological and physical health effects of caregiving, identified caregivers at risk for adverse outcomes, and evaluated a wide range of intervention strategies to support caregivers. Caregiving as chronic stress exposure is the conceptual driver for much of this research. We review and synthesize the literature on the impact of caregiving and intervention strategies for supporting caregivers. The impact of caregiving is highly variable, driven largely by the intensity of care provided and the suffering of the care recipient. The intervention literature is littered with many failures and some successes. Successful interventions address both the pragmatics of care and the emotional toll of caregiving. We conclude with both research and policy recommendations that address a national agenda for caregiving.},

  abstract = {Purpose:               To review progress in the conceptualization and measurement of five concepts related to doing family caregiving well: caregiving mastery, self-efficacy, competence, preparedness, and quality. Families are increasingly involved in providing complex care to ill or aged family members at home. Their ability to do caregiving well is vitally important and a focus of nursing practice in many clinical settings.                                         Organizing framework:               Concepts were organized into two groups: those that refer to caregivers' perceptions of how well they are providing care and those that refer to professional assessment of the quality of care provided.                                         Sources:               Family caregiving literature from nursing, gerontology, psychology, and social work, 1987--1996.                                         Findings:               There is growing interest in doing family caregiving well. However, research in this area is limited by the current state of development of ideas and measures.                                         Conclusions:               Two issues that should be addressed to advance research are the perspective taken on doing caregiving well and change over time in doing caregiving well.                        ,              Conceptualizaci\'on y medida                            de la ejecuci\'on de un buen cuidado familiar                                         Proposito: Revisar el progreso de la conceptualizaci\'on y medida de cinco conceptos relacionados a la ejecuci\'on de un buen cuidado familiar:               Dominio del cuidado, autoeficacia, competencia, \'optima preparaci\'on y calidad. Las familias estan m\'as envueltas en proveer cuidados complejos a los miembros enfermos y envejecidos dentro del hogar. La capacidad de ellos para entregar un cuidado bueno es de vital importancia y este es el enfoque de la pr\'actica de la enfermer\'ia en muchas situaciones cl\'inicas.                                         Marco conceptual:               Este se organiz\'o en dos grupos. El primer grupo era de aquellos que hacian referencias a las percepciones de los proveedores de cuidado de cuan bien lo ejecutaban. El otro grupo eran los que se refer\'ian al estimado profesional de la calidad del cuidado provisto por el familiar.

Hallazgos:               Existe un inter\'es creciente en la ejecuci\'on de un buen cuidado familiar, sin embargo las investigaciones en esta \'area estan limitadas por el estado de desarrollo de las ideas y medidas. Dos puntos de interes que deber\'ian ser considerados para adelantar estas investigaciones son; la perspectiva de ejecutarlo en una forma apropiada y el cambio a trav\'es del tiempo en la ejecucion del mismo.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Growing interest is evident in longitudinal mixed methods research, particularly fully longitudinal mixed methods designs in which both quantitative and qualitative data are collected concurrently for the duration of the study. Fully longitudinal mixed methods designs are particularly relevant for research on dynamic phenomena because of their ability to illuminate both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of change in real time as the phenomenon of interest changes. However, these are complex research designs and their data-intense nature makes them potentially burdensome for study participants, challenging for research teams, and costly for funding agencies. Despite growing use, the methodological literature on fully longitudinal mixed methods research is sparse and little guidance is available for researchers considering this approach. We address this gap by describing our experience with the design and implementation of a fully longitudinal mixed methods study of a dynamic phenomenon, namely, family caregiving during cancer treatment. We describe important questions and key decisions confronted while developing the research proposal, proactive strategies for study implementation, and implementation realities encountered while the study was in progress. On the basis of insights gained through real-world experience, we offer three guiding principles for researchers undertaking such a study. First, align the study design with the nature of the dynamics in the phenomenon of interest. Second, plan from the start when and how the integration of the longitudinal quantitative and qualitative data will occur. Third, employ implementation strategies that take into account the practical aspects of repeated contacts with study participants for an extended period.},

One population that often requires complex community-based care is survivors of prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV). This investigation explored the choices and challenges of eight family caregivers of PMV survivors. Using content analysis, several mutually exclusive themes emerged describing the caregiving experience as a physically exhausting, emotionally stressful decision that required a lifestyle change to actualize. Even with the burdensome challenges and overwhelming nature of the caregiving experience, participants identified positive rewards associated with the caregiving role. Home health care nurses are in a unique position to facilitate an effective transition to the caregiving role, serving as conduits for caregiver education and skill acquisition and advocating for the development of vital infrastructures that will provide resources, reassurance, and respite from burdensome caregiving challenges.},

To examine the health insurance coverage options for Medicaid expansion elected to expand Medicaid, all adults with enrollees if the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is repealed, using evidence from Ohio, where incomes below 138\% of the federal poverty more than half a million adults have enrolled in the state's Medicaid program through the ACA expansion. Methods. The Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey interviewed 42 000 households in 2015. We report data from a unique battery of questions designed to identify insurance coverage immediately prior to Medicaid enrollment. Results. Ninety-five percent of new Medicaid enrollees in Ohio did not have a private health insurance option immediately before enrollment. These new enrollees are predominantly older, low-income Whites with a high school education or less. Only 5\% of new Medicaid enrollees were eligible for an employer-sponsored insurance plan to which they could potentially return in the case of repeal of the ACA. Conclusions. The vast majority of Medicaid expansion enrollees would have no plausible pathway to obtaining private-sector insurance if the ACA were repealed. level (FPL) are now eligible for enrollment.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that is chronic, progressive and terminal across an interval of approximately five to ten years from the time of diagnosis. Disease management in AD and other illnesses has been conceptualized in a number of ways, including the Health Co-Inquiry approach (a cooperative endeavor that activates stakeholders, regards all stakeholder views, uses evidence-based practice, and strives for integrated care). With growth of Internet use, Health Co-Inquiry may occur online as stakeholders in chronic disease management search for and give information and support. The current study is a first look at the online posts of all AD stakeholders. Our goal is to shed light on their experiences by characterizing the themes in their posts. A Bifurcated Method was used with quantitization of information through a web-crawling program in order to corroborate or refute the findings from an inductive, thematic (qualitative) analysis. Results indicate that AD stakeholders utilize the Internet for: information, assistance, emotional support or relief, and advice about decision-making and behaviour challenges. Persons with AD posted little compared to caregivers and were prone to report subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and ask for help regarding diagnosis. Caregivers were apt to divulge personal stories, ask whether they should deceive a person with AD, and request information about coping or note that posting online was a coping mechanism. Providers', agencies' and companies' posts were likely to give information and offer technical advice, answer specific caregiver questions, and offer paid services/clinical trials. As a first study of all AD stakeholder online narratives, data indicate that more than half of sites and posts are dedicated to the concerns of caregivers and persons with AD, indicating that they are engaging in some aspects of Health Co-Inquiry online.},

Hope, wisdom, creativity, future mindedness, courage, spirituality, responsibility, and perseverance are ignored or explained as transformations of more authentic negative impulses. The 15 articles in this millennial issue of the American Psychologist discuss such issues as what enables happiness, the effects of autonomy and self-regulation, how optimism and hope affect health, what constitutes wisdom, and how talent and creativity come to fruition. The authors outline a framework for a science of positive psychology, point to gaps in our knowledge, and predict that the next century will see a science and profession that will come to understand and build the factors that allow individuals, communities, and societies to flourish.

Understanding what factors relate to the recognition of positive aspects of caregiving is important for the enhancement of caregiver well-being. Self-efficacy is a potentially modifiable psychological construct that has been associated with positive thinking, improved control of negative affect, and enhanced motivation. Methods: This study examined the relationship between positive aspects of caregiving and self-efficacy among 57 family members caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's disease. Participant data was gathered through individual interviews conducted as a part of a larger randomized controlled trial of a caregiver intervention. Results: We found that self-efficacy accounted for a significant percentage of the variance in positive aspects of caregiving after controlling for other factors commonly associated with positive aspects of caregiving including caregiver demographics, care recipient neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregiver depression. Conclusions: Our results suggest that high self-efficacy relates to caregivers' perception of positive aspects of the caregiving experience.},

  abstract = {Abstract             An analysis of endemic deprivation in India and of the role of public action in addressing that problem. The analysis is based on a broad view of economic development, focusing on human well-being and `social opportunity' rather than on the standard indicators of economic growth. India's success in reducing endemic deprivation since Independence has been quite limited. Recent diagnoses of this failure of policy have concentrated on the counterproductive role of government regulation, and on the need for economic incentives to accelerate the growth of the economy. This book argues that an assessment of India's failure to eliminate basic deprivations has to go beyond this limited focus, and to take note of the role played in that failure by inadequate public involvement in the provision of basic education, health care, social security, and related fields, Even the fostering of fast and participatory economic growth requires some basic social change, which is not addressed by liberalization and economic incentives. The authors also discuss the historical antecedents of these political and social neglects, including the distortion of policy priorities arising from inequalities of political power. Following on from this, the book considers the scope for public action to address these earlier biases and achieve a transformation of policy priorities. The introductory chapter presents the motivation, focus, and approach of the book. Chapter 2 discusses the respective roles of the market mechanism and government action in economic development and discusses the particular role of public involvement in the fields of health and education. In chapters 3 and 4, international comparisons of development experiences are brought to bear on the diagnosis of India's successes and failures. These two chapters also discuss the lessons to be learnt from the contrasting development experiences of different states within India, with particular attention to Kerala's outstanding success in social fields. Chapter 5 considers the role of public action and political organization in promoting social opportunities. Attention is drawn, in particular, to the part played by widespread illiteracy in suppressing that process and perpetuating social inequalities. The issue of basic education is further examined in chapter 6, which includes a critical assessment of public policy in this field. Chapter 7 discusses the specific problem on gender inequality, and the role of women's agency in the expansion of social opportunities for both women and men. The concluding chapter consolidates the argument and discusses the policy implication of the analyses presented. A statistical appendix presents a comparative picture of India and other developing countries, and also the comparative performance of different states within India.},

Health literacy is increasingly recognized as an important factor in patient compliance, cancer screening utilization, and chronic disease outcomes. Commendable efforts have been initiated by the American Medical Association and other organizations to address low health literacy among patients. Less work has been done, however, to place health literacy in the broader context of socioeconomic and cultural differences among patients and providers that hinder communication and compliance. This review examines cultural influences on health literacy, cancer screening and chronic disease outcomes. We argue that cultural beliefs around health and illness contribute to an individual's ability to understand and act on a health care provider's instructions. This paper proposes key aspects of the intersection between health literacy and culturally varying beliefs about health which merit further exploration.},

  abstract = {Few population-based studies have directly compared caregivers of persons with dementia to caregivers of persons with other disabilities (nondementia caregivers). We enrolled dementia and nondementia caregivers who were providing substantial and sustained care and compared these groups on measures of caregiver stressors, appraisals of burden, and well-being.Caregivers (N = 251) who provided continuous care for at least 1 year and at least 5 h per week were recruited from the population-based REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. Caregivers reported on dementia caregiving status, stressors, burden, and well-being.Forty-seven percent (n = 117) reported caring for a person with dementia. Dementia caregivers reported more stressors, providing more care for self-care and behavioral problems than nondementia caregivers. Dementia caregivers also reported higher appraisals of stress and burden, and more depressive symptoms, but did not differ from nondementia caregivers on mental and physical health quality of life. In multivariable-adjusted models, adjustment for the total number of care recipient problems attenuated differences between dementia and nondementia caregivers on burden and depression measures.Dementia and nondementia caregivers showed relatively few differences in indicators of overall well-being in this population-based sample, perhaps because both groups of caregivers in this study were providing substantial care. Dementia caregivers may require special assistance with dementia-specific problems such as behavioral problems. Clinical interventions and policy changes targeting highly burdened caregivers are needed to support them in allowing their care recipients to age in place at home.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined the associations of informal (eg, family members and friends) and formal (eg, physician and visiting nurses) social support with caregiver's burden in long-term care and the relationship between the number of available sources of social support and caregiver burden. METHODS: We conducted a mail-in survey in 2003 and used data of 2998 main caregivers of frail older adults in Aichi, Japan. We used a validated scale to assess caregiver burden. RESULTS: Multiple linear regression demonstrated that, after controlling for caregivers' sociodemographic and other characteristics, informal social support was significantly associated with lower caregiver burden ({$\beta$} = -1.59, P {$<$} 0.0001), while formal support was not ({$\beta$} = -0.30, P = 0.39). Evaluating the associations by specific sources of social support, informal social supports from the caregiver's family living together ({$\beta$} = -0.71, P {$<$} 0.0001) and from relatives ({$\beta$} = -0.61, P = 0.001) were associated with lower caregiver burden, whereas formal social support was associated with lower caregiver burden only if it was from family physicians ({$\beta$} = -0.56, P = 0.001). Compared to caregivers without informal support, those who had one support ({$\beta$} = -1.62, P {$<$} 0.0001) and two or more supports ({$\beta$} = -1.55, P {$<$} 0.0001) had significantly lower burden. This association was not observed for formal support. CONCLUSIONS: Social support from intimate social relationships may positively affect caregivers' psychological wellbeing independent of the receipt of formal social support, resulting in less burden.},

The focus of this model is on reciprocity of exchange in occupational life where high-cost/low-gain conditions are considered particularly stressful. Variables measuring low reward in terms of low status control (e.g., lack of promotion prospects, job insecurity) in association with high extrinsic (e.g., work pressure) or intrinsic (personal coping pattern, e.g., high need for control) effort independently predict new cardiovascular events in a prospective study on blue-collar men. Furthermore, these variables partly explain prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, atherogenic lipids) in 2 independent studies. Studying adverse health effects of high-effort/low-reward conditions seems well justified, especially in view of recent developments of the labor market.},

  abstract = {Today, ethnographers and qualitative researchers in fields such as urban poverty, immigration, and social inequality face an environment in which their work will be read, cited, and assessed by demographers, quantitative sociologists, and even economists. They also face a demand for case studies of poor, minority, or immigrant groups and neighborhoods that not only generate theory but also somehow speak to empirical conditions in other cases (not observed). Many have responded by incorporating elements of quantitative methods into their designs, such as selecting respondents `at random' for small, in-depth interview projects or identifying `representative' neighborhoods for ethnographic case studies, aiming to increase generalizability. This article assesses these strategies and argues that they fall short of their objectives. Recognizing the importance of the predicament underlying the strategies --- to determine how case studies can speak empirically to other cases --- it presents two alternatives to current practices, and calls for greater clarity in the logic of design when producing ethnographic research in a multi-method intellectual environment.},

  abstract = {Accessible Summary What is known on the subject? Several studies explore and describe the role of family dynamics in dementia care. However, few focus specifically on the diversity of family relationships that influence family caregivers' experiences of providing care to a relative with dementia. The role of family caregivers engaging in unpaid care of relatives with dementia is becoming more and more critical as the numbers of people living with dementia increase across the globe. Family caregivers are a diverse group of people as there are different categories of kinship relations and thus cannot be viewed as a single collective. They are linked intricately to their family and social support systems, however, they often experience limited family support, and tensions between family members can be a major source of stress. Hence, health professionals need to deepen their understanding of family relationships to enable them to provide effective advocacy and clinical support to family caregivers. What the paper adds to existing knowledge? This study is unique in that it focuses on a range of family relationships in which a person with dementia finds themselves. It highlights that this network of complex connections influences the caregiving process. The study demonstrates the important role that siblings can play in sharing the caregiving load. However, this sharing is rarely balanced or fair and there is always someone in the family who carries the heaviest load. Communication between family members is frequently a challenge, with family members experiencing denial or an inability to understand the challenges encountered by the family caregiver. Most studies focus on the relationship between the family caregiver and the relative with dementia alone, rather than the family network of the family caregiver and how it influences the caregiving process. This study is unique as it focuses on family dynamics and the family network, particularly the range of family relationships in which family caregivers and their relative with dementia find themselves. Other studies tend to focus on a specific kinship category and the family network, such as an adult child, caring for their parent, but this study presents a wide variety of kinship categories to demonstrate the diversity of family caregiving contexts. The family caregivers in this study all highlighted the need or desire for effective support from the family network. Challenges of communication between family members and the caregiver were also evident and were framed within the existing family dynamic of each family. What are the implications for mental health nursing? The findings suggest the need for communication (training and therapeutic) interventions between family caregivers and other family members (secondary caregivers). Mental health nurses are often well positioned to offer the family caregiver the option to undertake such an intervention. The findings emphasize the diversity of family caregiving situations and argue that mental health nurses can assess the nature of the care situations and work with families on how best to address the needs of the relative with dementia and the main caregiver. However, tensions frequently exist between family members, some of which existed prior to the relative acquiring dementia and other tensions as a consequence of the relative acquiring dementia. Mental health nurses could assist as a mediator between family members in order to assist families to become more cohesive. Abstract Introduction This article explores the diverse nature of family caregivers, focusing on the different categories of kinship relations. Family caregivers are linked intricately to their families, but often experience limited family support, causing stress and tension between family members. Aim The article aims to explore the family relationships of family members caring for relatives with dementia in order to provide an insight into the role of such relationships on the caregiver relative with dementia dyad. Method A phenomenological, exploratory-descriptive design was used. Eight participants took part and data were obtained using collages and semi-structured interviews. Results A range of family relationship patterns was highlighted including sibling involvement in the caregiving process; spousal involvement in supporting a caregiver of a parent; and spousal involvement in caring for their spouse. Discussion The family caregivers highlighted the need or desire for effective support from the family network. Challenges of communication between family members and the caregiver were also evident and were framed within the existing family dynamic of each family. Implications for Practice Mental health nurses need to deepen their understanding of family relationships to enable them to provide effective advocacy and clinical support to family caregivers and assist families to become more cohesive.},

  abstract = {Objectives: This longitudinal study explores whether the working situation (no change in working hours despite care, reduction of working hours due to care or not working) moderates mental and physical health of informal caregivers of older people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Italy. Methods: Data from a sample of 146 caregivers of older people with moderate AD involved in the UP-TECH trial across three waves were analysed. Multivariate analyses were used to study the association between independent variables (caregivers' work situation) and dependent variables (caregivers' psycho-physical health). In a second model, elements relating to the caregiver, the cared-for individual and the caregiving situation were added as controls. Results: Being forced to reduce working hours due to care tasks or not being employed independently from care was negatively associated with informal caregiver's physical health, compared with working carers not experiencing reduction of working hours. In the extended model, this result was confirmed. In comparison with working carers not forced to reduce working hours, non-working carers experienced higher levels of caregiver burden and depression, however these results were not confirmed in the adjusted model. Other factors also emerged as important including weekly hours of care, the cared-for older individual's ADL/IADL scores and informal support network. Conclusions: Given the positive effect of labour force participation on health of informal caregivers of older people with AD, policy makers should promote their employment avoiding their forced reduction of working hours, while also putting measures in place to decrease the intensity of informal care provision.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interest in physical and mental health outcomes in caregivers of patients with dementia is increasing. However, there is limited data available on the prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts, and suicide rates among caregivers of those with dementia. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review these outcomes to address this gap in the literature and thus provide information to inform future policy and intervention for the benefit of caregivers of dementia patients. METHODS: We searched several databases from inception to the 10th November 2021, for studies investigating suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts, and suicide rates of caregivers of patients with dementia. We report data regarding suicidal ideation as prevalence, with the 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), applying a random-effect model; since less than three studies were available for suicide attempt and suicide, these data are reported descriptively. RESULTS: Among 194 articles, eight comprising 1,209 informal caregivers of people with dementia (mean age: 63.9~years, 74\% females) were included. The prevalence of suicide ideation was 32.32\% (95\% CI: 16.01-48.64\%; I2\,=\,98.5\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). The prevalence of suicide ideation varied between studies from 4.69\% to 77.78\%. Two studies reported the rate of suicidal attempt in caregivers of patients with dementia, with the prevalence ranging from 5.9\% to 16.1\%. One study reported one in 17 caregivers of patients with dementia died by suicide. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of suicide ideation is high, affecting several caregivers of patients with dementia. These findings suggest intervention and/or policy are urgently needed to address suicidal behavior in this at-risk population.},

Whereas the consistency among the different aspects of identity is emphasized in Western cultures, the "multiple selves" are often viewed as coexisting realities in East Asian cultures. This research revisits the classic thesis in psychology that identity consistency is a prerequisite condition of psychological well-being. Between individuals (Study 1), people with a more consistent self-view had a more clear self-knowledge, were more assertive, and, most notably, had self-experiences that were less affected by the perspectives of others. Compared with North American participants (Study 2), Koreans viewed themselves more flexibly across situations, and their subjective well-being was less predictable from levels of identity consistency. Also, consistent individuals received positive social evaluations from others in the United States but not in Korea. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are terminal conditions impacting families and caregivers, particularly at end-of-life. Longitudinal, secondary data analyses present opportunities for insight into dementia caregiving and decision-making over time; however, joining complex datasets and preparing them for analysis poses many challenges. Objectives: To describe an approach to linking national survey data of older adults with their primary caregivers to build a prospective, longitudinal dataset, and to share the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) coding statement algorithms with other researchers. Methods: The National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and National Study of Caregiving (NSOC) are joined using a series of algorithms based on conceptual and operational definitions of dementia, primary caregivers, and the occurrence of death. A series of SAS algorithms resulting in the final longitudinal dataset was created. Results: NHATS/NSOC participants were linked using three preliminary data files (n = 12~427) and one final data join (n = 3305) over nine rounds of data collection. Presence of dementia was defined based on the indicator in the year preceding the last month-of-life (LML) interview. Primary caregivers were defined as the person providing the most frequent care over time. Additional flag variables (LML interview, dementia classification, and cohort (2011 vs 2015)) were created. The SAS algorithms are presented herein. Discussion: The SAS coding statement algorithms provide an opportunity to conduct longitudinal analysis of care for both members of the dyad in the context of dementia and end-of-life. Future research using the proposed dataset can further explore care and caregiving in these populations.},

  abstract = {Background: In recent years, numerous dementia caregiving interventions for informal caregivers of community-dwelling people with dementia have been developed. However, it remains unclear which non-pharmacological interventions are effective and preferred for their depression and anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden. Objectives: To compare and rank the efficacy of different non-pharmacological interventions on depression, anxiety, quality of life, and caregiver burden for informal caregivers of people with dementia. Design: A systematic review and network meta-analysis. Methods: Relevant randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for informal caregivers of people with dementia were extracted from seven electronic databases. A network meta-analysis was then performed to evaluate the relative efficacy of the non-pharmacological interventions for informal caregivers of people with dementia. The quality of the data was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results: A total of 85 randomized controlled trials on 11 non-pharmacological interventions were included in the final analysis. Acceptance and commitment therapy, behavioral activation, mindfulness-based intervention, multicomponent intervention, psychoeducation, and cognitive behavioral therapy might reduce depression. Notably, psychoeducation was the only effective intervention against anxiety. Only support groups had a statistically significant effect on the quality of life. When considering decreasing caregiver burden, case management, psychoeducation, and multicomponent intervention would be the effective interventions. Conclusions: Several non-pharmacological interventions seemed to be effective in treating depression and anxiety, improving quality of life, and reducing caregiver burden for informal caregivers of people with dementia. Healthcare professionals should be encouraged to apply these non-pharmacological interventions for informal caregivers of people with dementia during routine care.},

Eighteen publications on Chinese American dementia family caregivers published in peer-reviewed journals between 1990 and early 2011 were identified. Based on a systematic database search and review process, we found that caregivers' beliefs concerning dementia and the concept of family harmony as evidenced through the practice of filial piety are permeating cultural values, which together affect attitudes toward research and help-seeking behaviors (ie, seeking information on diagnosis and using formal services). There is also evidence to suggest that these cultural beliefs impinge on key elements of the caregiving process, including caregivers' appraisal of stress, coping strategies, and informal and formal support. The study concludes with recommendations for future research and practice with the Chinese American population.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To explore associations between carer burden and characteristics of (1) the informal carer, (2) the person with dementia, and (3) the care support network in 8 European countries. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: People with dementia judged at risk of admission to long-term care (LTC) facilities in 8 European countries (Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom). Participants: A total of 1223 people with dementia supported by community services at home or receiving day care or respite care and their informal carers. Measurements: Variables regarding the informal carer included familial relationship and living situation. Variables relating to the person with dementia included cognitive functioning (S-MMSE), neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q), depressive symptoms (Cornell depression scale), comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index), and physical functioning (Katz Activity of Daily Living [ADL] Index). The care support network was measured using hours of caregiving (ADLs, instrumental ADLs [IADLs], supervision), additional informal care support, and service receipt (home care, day care). Experience of carer burden was recorded using the Zarit Burden Interview. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with high carer burden. Results: Carer burden was highest in Estonia (mean 39.7/88) and lowest in the Netherlands (mean 26.5/88). High burden was significantly associated with characteristics of the informal carer (family relationship, specifically wives or daughters), of the person with dementia (physical dependency in ADLs; neuropsychiatric symptoms, in particular nighttime behaviors and irritability), the care support network (hours of caregiving supervision; receipt of other informal care support) and country of residence. Conclusion: A range of factors are associated with burden in informal carers of people with dementia judged to be on the margins of LTC. Support for informal carers needs to take account of gender differences. The dual challenges of distressed behaviors and difficulties in ADLs by the person with dementia may be addressed by specific nonpharmacological interventions focusing on both elements. The potential protective effect of additional informal support to carers highlights the importance of peer support or better targeted home support services. The implementation of appropriate and tailored interventions to reduce burden by supporting informal carers may enable people with dementia to remain at home for longer.},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that intergenerational relations---the relationships between adult children and their parents in particular---are becoming increasingly important to Americans. Two main social forces appear to be driving these changes: marital instability and broader demographic shifts. Intergenerational relationships involve both affective ties and more instrumental forms of support such as financial resources or child care. Although actual material assistance tends to be episodic and primarily responsive to specific needs, these relationships appear to be durable and flexible and often fill in when marriage or other emotional attachments deteriorate. As such, intergenerational family relations may reflect adaptations to contemporary, postmodern economic and cultural conditions. Variations in these general patterns and dynamics are also exhibited, the most striking of which are those involving race and class. These variations are driven largely by social structure and position and suggest that intergenerational relations constitute an important and largely hidden aspect of how families contribute to the reproduction of social inequality in society. These findings reinforce the value of extending both scholarly and cultural notions of family beyond the traditional nuclear family model.},

His analysis of the epidemic emphasized the economic, social, and cultural factors involved in its etiology, and clearly identified the contradictory social forces that prevented any simple solution. Instead of recommending medical changes (i.e., more doctors or hospitals), he outlined a revolutionary program of social reconstruction; including full employment, higher wages, the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, universal education, and the disestablishment of the Catholic Church. This article includes the first English translation of these long-term recommendations. It also locates Virchow's Report within the context of the Medical Reform Movement of 1848 and traces his influence on the subsequent development of social medicine. Parallels are drawn between Virchow's attempts to reform health care and current developments in the political economy of health.},

Methods.\enspace{} Data derive from the Social Networks in Adult Life survey, a national probability sample of older adults (N = 689). Ordinary least squares regression was used to examine the impact of total support, size of support network, number of types of support, and types of alter support relationships---both given and received---on well-being. Results.\enspace{} Providing support to others is beneficial to older adults' well-being, as illustrated in the relatively strong, positive associations of total support given, the number of types of support given, and support given to friends and children on well-being. Receiving support was less important to well-being except when received from a spouse or sibling. Conclusion.\enspace{} Evidence from this analysis provides support for hypotheses predicted by identity theory, highlights the importance of examining giving and receiving support net of the other, and suggests that it is often better for the wellbeing of older adults to give than to receive.},

  abstract = {Building on Max Weber's observation that the state's reliance on formal tools leads to governance for some and dehumanization for others, we investigate administrative standards as a social mechanism of stratification that sorts people into categories and allocates symbolic and financial resources. Specifically, we examine how at a time of increased family diversity, the state's use of family standards at the end-of-life discounts certain people as kin. Based on ethnographic and documentary data about government's implementation of family standards to identify next-of-kin and task them with the disposition of dead bodies, we find that the use of family standards leads to three outcomes: a formal fit between standard and family forms; a formal misfit between who is designated next-of-kin and who is willing to handle disposition, leading to bodies going unclaimed; and a formal refit, where people not officially designated as next-of-kin overcome formal barriers to disposition. Our analysis offers a conceptual framework to examine how administrative standards include and exclude people from social groups. These bureaucratic tools produce a standard-specific governable life for some, and a diverse range of oppositional effects varying from non-recognition to opportunism for the non-standardized.},

Although partial checklists are available, no consolidated reporting framework exists for any type of qualitative design. Objective. To develop a checklist for explicit and comprehensive reporting of qualitative studies (indepth interviews and focus groups). Methods. We performed a comprehensive search in Cochrane and Campbell Protocols, Medline, CINAHL, systematic reviews of qualitative studies, author or reviewer guidelines of major medical journals and reference lists of relevant publications for existing checklists used to assess qualitative studies. Seventy-six items from 22 checklists were compiled into a comprehensive list. All items were grouped into three domains: (i) research team and reflexivity, (ii) study design and (iii) data analysis and reporting. Duplicate items and those that were ambiguous, too broadly defined and impractical to assess were removed. Results. Items most frequently included in the checklists related to sampling method, setting for data collection, method of data collection, respondent validation of findings, method of recording data, description of the derivation of themes and inclusion of supporting quotations. We grouped all items into three domains: (i) research team and reflexivity, (ii) study design and (iii) data analysis and reporting. Conclusions. The criteria included in COREQ, a 32-item checklist, can help researchers to report important aspects of the research team, study methods, context of the study, findings, analysis and interpretations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Gender and migrant status are important factors for health. A common finding is that women report poorer health than men and that migrants'health converges with nonmigrants' health as the duration of stay in the host country increases. However, little is known about whether gender differences in health persist within migrant groups and whether the migrant--native health convergence differs by gender, especially in the Italian context. OBJECTIVE This study aims to include the gender dimension in the analysis of the health differences between Italians and migrants by duration of stay, focusing on how gender interacts with duration of stay in determining migrants' health. METHODS We performed multivariate logistic regression on a sample of 70,154 residents in Italy aged 20--64, using the 2013 Italian Health Survey. We modelled the association between duration of stay and three health dimensions by gender and computed predicted probabilities to show the interaction effect of gender and duration of stay. RESULTS We found evidence of a migrant health advantage among recent migrant men and women that becomes weaker among long-term migrants. After a long duration of stay, differences in health between migrants and nonmigrants are slightly more pronounced among women than among men. CONTRIBUTION This is the first study in Italy that contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the role played by gender in determining the health differences observed. The study highlights the need to consider migrant status and gender in tandem when looking at adult health inequalities.}

Long-term care measures and policies cannot take place without taking into account the quantitatively crucial role played by informal caregivers.

This rate ranges between about 13 percent in Portugal and Spain, and more than 22 percent in Luxembourg, Belgium, and Denmark. It declines in older age groups and, on average, is lower in men than in women in all countries studied, and lower among the poorly educated compared to those with higher levels of education. However, large variance was observed in the average share of informal caregivers for most countries between the three surveys. Our findings, estimated through the three surveys, reveal common trends, but also a series of disparities.

We use the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS), the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), and the Study on Health and Ageing in Europe (SHARE) to measure the prevalence of informal caregivers in the European population, and analyze associated socio-demographic factors. This rate ranges between about 13 percent in Portugal and Spain, and more than 22 percent in Luxembourg, Belgium, and Denmark. It declines in older age groups and, on average, is lower in men than in women in all countries studied, and lower among the poorly educated compared to those with higher levels of education. However, large variance was observed in the average share of informal caregivers for most countries between the three surveys. Our findings, estimated through the three surveys, reveal common trends, but also a series of disparities. Additional research will be needed to enable policy makers to access a richer and more harmonized body of data, allowing them to adopt truly evidence-based and targeted policies and interventions in this field.},

  abstract = {Illness has many facets. It is a phenomenon that is at once bio-physical, social, psychological and cultural in nature. Today this is a commonplace observation, even if there is disagreement as to what particular events should be called illness. At the same time, it is relatively new. Only recently has illness become an event for which explanations could be sought outside the realm of biology and medicine, and such fields as psychology and sociology could seriously seek to interpret it. In this paper a brief review and appraisal will be made of one way in which illness has been treated as a dependent property by sociology. At least since 1951, sociologist most frequently have interpreted illness as a form of deviant behavior characterized by involuntary incapacities for participation in the social order. To analyze this perspective, we will examine the nature of social deviance, the ways in which illness ``fits'' the deviance model, the limitations of the deviance framework for the analysis of illness, and the major unexplored questions suggested by the orientation. Obviously, this is an overly ambitious undertaking for a paper, and what follows will be more suggestive than definitive.},

Individuals engaging in these cultures are motivated to maximize the experience of positive affect. Moreover, happiness is best predicted by self-esteem. In contrast, in East Asian cultural contexts, happiness tends to be defined in terms of interpersonal connectedness. Individuals engaging in these cultures are motivated to maintain a balance between positive and negative affects. Moreover, happiness is best predicted by perceived embeddedness of the self in a social relationship. Directions for future research are discussed.},

At present, however, little is known about the nature of these models. Here, the authors systematically analyzed American and Japanese participants' spontaneously produced descriptions of the two emotions and observed, as predicted, that whereas Americans associated positive hedonic experience of happiness with personal achievement, Japanese associated it with social harmony. Furthermore, Japanese were more likely than Americans to mention both social disruption and transcendental reappraisal as features of happiness. As also predicted, unlike happiness, descriptions of unhappiness included various culture-specific coping actions: Whereas Americans focused on externalizing behavior (e.g., anger and aggression), Japanese highlighted transcendental reappraisal and self-improvement.

  abstract = {Objective: Supporting informal caregivers of persons with dementia is considered to be an effective strategy for improving the well-being of caregivers and care recipients and for delaying nursing home placement. Although considerable research has been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of psychoeducational interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational therapy, research into the effectiveness of respite care is rare. This systematic review aims to investigate the effectiveness of different types of respite care in supporting informal caregivers of persons with dementia. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using Web of Science and PubMed, and the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies was used to assess the methodological quality. Randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, pretest--posttest studies without a control group, and cohort studies were included. Results: Seventeen papers met the inclusion criteria. Day care services are effective in decreasing caregiver burden and behavioral problems in persons with dementia, but they also accelerate time to nursing home admission. The results of temporary residential admission are rather mixed and show unexpected adverse effects on both caregivers and care recipients. High-quality comparable evidence on community-based respite care is still lacking, although earlier qualitative evidence indicated promising results. Conclusion: Unlike in previous reviews, we were able to draw some conclusions about the effectiveness of some types of respite care. There is nonetheless still a need for new intervention studies measuring the impact of respite care, especially in-home respite care programs, on the caregiver, the care recipient, and health care resource utilization.

  abstract = {Introduction Too often dementia care is still fragmented and unresponsive to the needs of people living with dementia and their family caregivers. To develop effective health care services, in-depth insight into the experiences of family caregivers is a prerequisite. Methods This Dutch study is a qualitative interview study. The aim was twofold: 1) to develop an in-depth understanding of what it means to live with dementia and 2) to gain insight into what constitutes the art of living with dementia, both from the perspective of family caregivers. Data were gathered through 47 interviews with individuals and 6 focus group interviews. The analysis followed a phenomenologically inspired thematic approach. Results The findings show that living with dementia can be understood as becoming entangled in uncertainty and isolation. The following themes illustrate this experience in various phases of the disease: a) Before the diagnosis: a growing uneasy feeling that something is amiss; b) The diagnostic disclosure: an uncertain and upsetting relief; c) Dementia at home: entangled in an isolated and exhausting life; d) Capitulation to relocation: torn between relief and grief. In addition, the study shows that the art of living with dementia is associated with: a) The ability to face tragedy; b) The discovery of meaning and dignity in the context of illness; c) Retaining a sense of connection and bond; d) The primacy of attention and recognition by others. Discussion and conclusion Our findings show that dealing with what Boss (2011) called `ambiguous loss-experiences' is one of the most demanding aspects of living with dementia. Based on the findings, we have developed a model that depicts how people handle contingency and seek balance along the continuum of facing and resisting. Our study shows that resilience in the context of living with dementia should not be understood as merely an individual mental ability, nor as a set of behaviours, but rather as a social-ecological enterprise.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of a qualitative study aimed at exploring the experiences and needs of informal caregivers of persons with dementia and identifying caregiver expectations for support. The research was based on phenomenological and social constructionist approaches; it also took experience-centred and culturally oriented approaches to narratives. It was conducted in Estonia in 2017 by means of unstructured in-depth interviews with 16 informal caregivers who had relatives with dementia. The narrative approach used in this study proved to be an appropriate and valuable method to understand the situations of the caregivers of the people with dementia, in identifying their needs and expectations, and in developing social understanding for caregivers. The results are divided under four thematic headings: awareness of dementia; process of caregiving and different caregiving roles; influence of caregiving on personal life; and expectations of empowerment. We found that it is necessary to raise public awareness of dementia and develop person-centred support services for the people living with dementia.},

During PAR, several support groups in different regions of Estonia were launched to empower the informal caregivers. In the study, the stakeholders and researchers participated as partners and developed new knowledge and 17 support groups were launched in different regions of Estonia.},

The first question is what subjective well-being is precisely, and, in particular, how we distinguish subjective well-being as such from its determinants. The second question--how people appraise how well they are--concerns the mental processes involved. The third question is about the conditions for subjective well-being and is closely linked to the question of how subjective well-being can be raised. Lastly a fourth question is about the consequences of subjective well-being, which links up to the ideological issue of whether subjective well-being should be raised. In this chapter I give an outline of how mainstream sociology has dealt with these four questions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {This article retraces the historical origins and contemporary resonances of Rudolf Virchow's famous statement ``Medicine is a social science, and politics nothing but medicine at a larger scale''. Virchow was convinced that social inequality was a root cause of ill-health, and that medicine therefore had to be a social science. Because of their intimate knowledge of the problems of society, doctors, according to Virchow, also were better statesmen. Although Virchow's analogies between biology and sociology are out of date, some of his core ideas still resonate in public health. This applies particularly to the notion that whole populations can be sick, and that political action may be needed to cure them. Aggregate population health may well be different from the sum (or average) of the health statuses of all individual members: populations sometimes operate as malfunctioning systems, and positive feedback loops will let population health diverge from the aggregate of individual health statuses. There is considerable controversy among epidemiologists and public health professionals about how far one should go in influencing political processes. A ``ladder of political activism'' is proposed to help clarify this issue, and examples of recent public health successes are given which show that some political action has often been required before effective public health policies and interventions could be implemented.},

  abstract = {Background Crisis is a term frequently used in dementia care lacking a standardized definition. This article systematically reviews existing definitions of crisis in dementia care literature to create a standardized definition that can be utilized for research, policy and clinical practice. Methods We systematically searched for articles containing definitions of crisis in the context of dementia care. We created an operational framework of crisis based on retrieved definitions. Recommendations to address crisis situations were reviewed and classified according to care settings. Results Abstracts and titles of 1,113 articles, screened from PubMed and EMBASE, were narrowed down to 27 articles. After review, crisis in dementia was defined as a process where a stressor causes an imbalance requiring an immediate decision to be made which leads to a desired outcome and therefore a resolution of the crisis. If the crisis is not resolved, the cycle continues. Recommendations for resolving crisis involving persons with dementia and their caregivers include awareness therapy after diagnosis and increased contact with general practitioners, case manager consultations, caregiver support and education. Furthermore, nursing home staff should be attuned to the environmental, physical and psychological needs of persons with dementia. Conclusions This is the first article to review the definition of crisis in the context of dementia care. A review of the literature indicated that the definition of a crisis is idiosyncratic. Therefore, it is difficult to prevent or plan for all crises. We used an operational framework to compile types of crisis stressors and recommendations from the crisis literature based on three different perspectives; the person with the dementia, the caregiver and the healthcare providers.},

The development of adequate communication skills is now a goal of training programs in the primary-care specialties.

The transmission of information is related to characteristics of patients (sex, education, social class, and prognosis), doctors (social-class background, income, and perception of patients' desire for information), and the clinical situation (number of patients seen). Doctors' nonverbal communication abilities are associated with outcomes of medical care such as satisfaction and compliance. Regarding the sociolinguistic structure of communication, doctors often maintain a style of high control, which involves many doctor-initiated questions, interruptions, and neglect of patients' "life world." Training programs and standards of clinical practice should emphasize that improved doctor-patient communication is both desirable and possible.},

Although historically the Marxist paradigm went into eclipse during the early twentieth century, the field has developed rapidly during recent years. The health system mirrors the society's class structure through control over health institutions, stratification of health workers, and limited occupational mobility into health professions. Monopoly capital is manifest in the growth of medical centers, financial penetration by large corporations, and the "medical-industrial complex." Health policy recommendations reflect different interest groups' political and economic goals. The state's intervention in health care generally protects the capitalist economic system and the private sector. Medical ideology helps maintain class structure and patterns of domination. Comparative international research analyzes the effects of imperialism, changes under socialism, and contradictions of health reform in capitalist societies. Historical materialist epidemiology focuses on economic cycles, social stress, illness-generating conditions of work, and sexism. Health praxis, the disciplined uniting of study and action, involves advocacy of "nonreformist reforms" and concrete types of political struggle.},

  abstract = {Social reproduction is a lens through which to analyse the persistence of society over time, even as its human and material components keep changing. Its main value is in identifying and explaining tensions that emerge between the logic that reproduces society, and the continued survival (biological reproduction) and wellbeing of the population. Its origins are in Karl Marx's critique of capitalist society, as governed by a drive towards accumulation. Initially, anthropologists have sought inspiration from Marx in examining the reproduction of non-capitalist societies, but they have since largely joined adjacent disciplines in focusing on capitalism. Modern social reproduction theory has proceeded from blind spots in Marx's analysis, primarily regarding the role of women and domestic work in maintaining current workers and non-workers. From there, it has expanded to examine other fault lines in the reproduction of capitalist society. Contemporary strands of social reproduction theory attend to crises that emerge with respect to care work and livelihoods as finance becomes the main motor of accumulation. They also underline ways in which the reproduction of society reproduces inequalities within it. For ethnographers, attention to social reproduction illuminates the entanglements of any chosen fieldsite and plights therein with broader dynamics of accumulation.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates human flourishing in five culturally distinct populations. Empirical differences in human flourishing were examined using the recently proposed Flourish Index (FI) and Secure Flourish Index (SFI). Five domains for human flourishing are proposed for FI: (D1) happiness and life satisfaction; (D2) physical and mental health; (D3) meaning and purpose; (D4) character and virtue; and (D5) close social relationships. Specification of SFI was augmented by an additional financial and material stability domain (D6). Psychometric properties of FI and SFI were examined using data from the SHINE Well-Being Survey. Between June 2017 and March 2018, a total of 8,873 respondents participated in the study -- in the US (4083 participants), Sri Lanka (1284 participants), Cambodia (587 participants), China (419 participants), and Mexico (2500 participants). US participants were customers of a financial institution, while non-US participants were clothing industry workers in the supply chain of a global brand. Exploratory and confirmatory factor models were used to validate the proposed indices. An exploratory approach informed analysis for item groupings. Confirmatory factor models were used to investigate the hierarchical structure of the indices. Configural, metric, and partial scalar measurement invariance were established, which not only supported the universal character of the indices but also validated use of the indices for culturally distinct populations. Findings from our study enrich our knowledge about human flourishing in five culturally distinct populations. With the exception of happiness and life satisfaction, respondents in the US, despite enjoying the highest financial and material stability, scored the lowest in all other domains of human flourishing. Respondents in China excelled in close social relationship and health domains. In addition to life satisfaction and happiness, character and virtue were relatively high in Cambodia. Respondents in Mexico, despite having the lowest scores in financial and material stability, had the greatest meaning and purpose to their lives. Respondents in Sri Lanka were the least happy and satisfied with life.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study describes the development and psychometric properties of a 24-item scale to be used in both research and practice settings that assesses the everyday care values and preferences of individuals with cognitive impairment and the perceptions of family caregivers about their relative's values and preferences for care. Design and Methods: The Values and Preferences Scale was developed on the basis of previous measures used with cognitively intact samples with additional items generated by the authors in consultation with an advisory committee of practitioners, researchers, family caregivers, and persons with cognitive impairment. Individuals with mild to moderate cognitive impairment and their family caregivers (n = 111) were interviewed for the study. Results: Results of a factor analysis determined that the Values and Preferences Scale can be divided into two domains or subscales for persons with cognitive impairment and their family caregivers (i.e., Environment--Social Network and Personal Autonomy). These domains were found to have good internal consistency for both the individuals and their caregivers (Cronbach's alphas ranged from.70 to.82). Evidence of their psychometric properties compared with measures of depression, quality of life, and involvement in decision making was also found. Implications: These findings suggest that persons with cognitive impairment are able to express values and preferences about care they currently receive or will need in the future. Further application and testing of the Values and Preferences Scale should prove useful to practitioners who assist those with cognitive impairment and their caregivers with daily care decisions and the development of care plans.},

This study aims to understand whether prepandemic resilience, education, or income predicted older adults' subsequent likelihood of reporting positive changes in their lives during the pandemic.We use data from the National Social Life, Heath, and Aging Project, an ongoing panel study with a COVID-19 ancillary supplement (N = 2,650).The study results aligned with the fundamental cause theory. In demographically adjusted models including resilience, education, and income, as well as the effect of the pandemic on employment and a COVID-disruption score, the odds of reporting any positive change were 2.6 times higher for those with an associate degree (p \&lt; .01) and 4.7 times higher for those with a bachelor's or higher (p \&lt; .001), compared to those without a high school degree. In contrast, neither resilience nor income was significantly associated with endorsing a positive change. We also categorize specific changes thematically coded from open-ended responses and examine their demographic distributions. Categories include spirituality, home organization, hygiene practices, and increased quality time with others.These findings show that older adults with more education could navigate COVID-19 challenges in a way that improved their perspectives on at least one aspect of their lives.},

At the same time, news media provide us with a daily catalogue of disasters from around the globe to remind us that we inhabit a world of crisis, insecurity and hazard. Anxiety in a Risk Society : looks at the problem of contemporary anxiety from a sociological perspective highlights its significance for the ways we make sense of risk and uncertainty argues that the relationship between anxiety and risk hinges on the nature of anxiety. Iain Wilkinson believes that there is much for sociologists to learn from those who have made the condition of anxiety the focus of their life's work. By making anxiety the focus of sociological inquiry, a critical vantage point can be gained from which to attempt an answer to the question: Are we more anxious because we are more risk conscious? This is an original and thought-provoking contribution to the understanding of late modernity as a risk society.},

  abstract = {Do unauthorized im/migrants have a right to health? Do they deserve health care, or health protection, or access to the social determinants of good health? Are they party to prevailing social contracts, or does their exclusion from mainstream systems of health promotion, prevention, and care ``make sense''? Questions like these, which generate considerable attention in multiple spheres of scholarship, policy, and public debate, revolve around an issue that merits substantially greater consideration among social scientists of health: health-related ``deservingness.'' In addition to putting the issue of health-related deservingness squarely on the map as an object of analysis, this article further argues that we cannot focus solely on those with power, influence, and public voice. Rather, we also must investigate how deservingness is reckoned in relation to -- and, furthermore, from the perspectives of -- unauthorized im/migrants and members of other groups commonly constructed in public and policy discourse as undeserving. Additionally, we must consider the complicated relationship between universalizing juridical arguments about formal entitlement to health rights, on one hand, and situationally specific, vernacular moral arguments about deservingness, on the other. The paper analyzes findings from a 29-month mixed-methods study conducted in Tel Aviv, Israel, that approached unauthorized im/migrants as subjects, rather than simply objects, of ethical deliberation. Participants' conceptions of health-related deservingness are investigated using two sources of data: (1) quantitative findings from a self-administered, closed-ended survey conducted with 170 im/migrant patients at an NGO-run Open Clinic (2002--2003), and (2) qualitative findings from the larger ethnographic study of which the survey was part (2000--2010). The study findings both (1) contradict commonly circulating assumptions that unauthorized im/migrants are ``freeloaders,'' and (2) highlight the need for rigorous investigation of how unauthorized im/migrants, among other marginalized and vulnerable groups, conceptualize their own relative deservingness of health-related concern and investment.},

Data from the 2015 Caregiving in the US survey (N = 1248) were used. Findings indicated male informal caregivers reported more financial strain compared to females. White women reported more emotional strain than women of color, and those with higher incomes reported less financial strain. Gender, race, and income were not significantly related to physical strain among informal caregivers. Implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

This review essay discusses the strengths and weaknesses of his ``processual'' approach, in comparison with other dynamic perspectives in sociology such as, in particular, Norbert Elias's ``process sociology.'' It critically questions central ideas and arguments advanced in this book: the reduction of social processes to ``events,'' the focus on stability as the central explanandum of sociological theory, the implicit separation of individual and social processes, the proposition that the social world changes faster than the individual, the idea that ``excess'' rather than ``scarcity'' is the central problematic of human affairs, the strong emphasis on the inherent normativity of sociological concepts, the focus on values as the core of human social life, the neglect of human interdependence, power, coercion, and violence, and the distinction between ``moral facts'' and ``empirical facts.'' Detailed criticisms of the arguments in various chapters are given, and alternative viewpoints are proposed. The conclusion is that Processual Sociology fails to provide a fruitful approach for understanding and explaining social processes, and that it even represents, in several respects, theoretical regression rather than progress.},

Estimating total societal costs demonstrates the wide impact of dementia and its main direct and indirect economic components. METHODS: We constructed a global cost model for dementia, presenting costs as cumulated global and regional costs. RESULTS: In 2019, the annual global societal costs of dementia were estimated at US \$1313.4 billion for 55.2 million people with dementia, corresponding to US \$23,796 per person with dementia. Of the total, US \$213.2 billion (16\%) were direct medical costs, US \$448.7 billion (34\%) direct social sector costs (including long-term care), and US \$651.4 billion (50\%) costs of informal care. DISCUSSION: The huge costs of dementia worldwide place enormous strains on care systems and families alike. Although most people with dementia live in low- and middle-income countries, highest total and per-person costs are seen in high-income countries. HIGHLIGHTS: Global~economic~costs of dementia~were estimated to reach US \$1313.4 in 2019. Sixty-one percent of people with dementia live in low-and middle-income countries, whereas 74\% of the costs occur in high-income countries. The impact of informal care~accounts for~about 50\% of the global costs. The development of a long-term care infrastructure is a great challenge for low-and middle-income countries. There is a great need for more cost studies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Discussions of a framework for global cost comparisons are needed.},

A total of 210 spousal care-giver/care-recipient dyads from four Chinese cities participated in a survey from July to August 2021. The survey used the Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale, Caregiver Task Inventory Scale and Gender Role Attitude Scale. Mediation and moderated mediation analysis found that care-giver self-efficacy partially mediated the path of the primary stressor and benefit-finding; formal support utilisation directly moderated the mediated pathways linking primary stressor, care-giver self-efficacy and benefit-finding; and gender role attitudes moderated these intersections. Qualitative analysis revealed that spousal care-givers with high self-efficacy, who used formal support services, and who had modern gender role attitudes found the most benefits in caregiving. The findings also suggested that professionals should recognise the influence of gender role attitudes in spousal caregiving and incorporate this understanding into the development of tailored psychoeducational interventions aimed at promoting care-giver well-being. \copyright{} 2023 The Author(s).

  abstract = {This paper explores the ways exploitative labour migration arrangements leading to `failed migration' can extend discussions of transnationalism. Specifically, failed migration produces different sorts of engagements in transnational social fields to those commonly discussed in the literature and in relation to migrants who are considered successful. These departures allow for reflection on key assumptions about the practices of connection and engagement across borders between migrants and non-migrants that typify the operation of transnational social fields, including the ways constructions of gender shape these practices. The paper draws on a case study of Bangladeshi low-waged, transient migrant workers in Singapore. I examine three registers of diluted connection, namely: protecting the family from anxiety; distress for migrants through imposition of censure and suspicion; and the shame associated with exploitation. Moral--cultural frames that inscribe particular economic and social expectations on migrants and, in this case, values associated with `being a man' transferred from home provide a lens through which to understand the reconfiguration of transnational social fields in the context of failed migration.},

METHODS: Subjects included in the study were 44 Alzheimer's disease patients and their primary caregivers. Patients were evaluated with Mini Mental State Examination, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Physical Self-Maintenance Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale, and carers were administered Maslach Burnout Inventory, Ways of Coping Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: The emotional exhaustion of caregivers revealed a significant relationship with the caregivers' anxiety, submissive approach for coping and the patient's self-maintenance. Depersonalisation was found to be related to the depression score of the patient. DISCUSSION: This study may serve to increase clinicians' awareness of burnout in relatives of dementia patients. It points to the fact that research for determining the causes and consequences of burnout in the family caregivers is warranted.},

  abstract = {Background: Informal dementia caregivers are those who care for a person living with dementia (PLWD) without receiving payment (e.g., family members, friends, or other unpaid caregivers). These informal caregivers are subject to substantial mental, physical, and financial burdens. Online communities enable these caregivers to exchange caregiving strategies and communicate experiences with other caregivers who they generally do not know in real life. Research has demonstrated the benefits of peer support in online communities, but they are limited in focusing merely on caregivers who are already online users. Objective: We aimed to investigate the perception and utilization of online peer support through a survey. Methods: Following the Andersen and Newman Framework of Health Services Utilization, we designed and administered a survey using Redcap to investigate the perception and utilization of online peer support among informal dementia caregivers. Specifically, we collected three types of information that will influence whether an informal dementia caregiver accesses online peer support: predisposing factors, which refers to the socio-culture characteristics of caregivers, relationship between caregivers and PLWD, and beliefs in the value of online peer support; enabling factors, which refers to the logistic aspects of accessing online peer support (e.g., eHealth Literacy, access to high-speed internet); need factors, which the most immediate cause of seeking online per support. We also collected caregivers' experience in accessing online communities. We distributed the survey link on November 14, 2022, on two online locations: Alzheimer's Association website as an advertisement, and ALZConnected, an online community organized by Alzheimer's Association. We collected all the responses on February 23, 2023, and conducted regression analysis to learn the factors that are associated with the access of online peer support. Results: We collected responses from 172 dementia caregivers. Among these participants, 140 (81.4\%) completed the entire survey. These caregivers were aged 19-87 with a mean of 54, and a majority were female (88\%) or White (90\%). Our findings show that the behavior to access any online community is only significantly associated with their belief in the value of online peer support (p = 0.006). Moreover, 33 (83\%) of the 40 non-online-community caregivers had a belief score above 24, a score assigned when a neutral option is selected for each belief question. The reasons most articulated for not accessing any online community were no time to do so (14; 10\%), and insufficient online information searching skills (9; 6\%). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that online peer support is valuable, but practical strategies are needed to assist informal dementia caregivers who have limited time or searching skills.},

To better understand how cultural factors underpin and shape motivations and willingness to provide informal care for adults, an in-depth qualitative synthesis was conducted. Six electronic databases and a wide range of additional sources were searched. Following meta-ethnographic guidelines, 37 qualitative studies were synthesised. Six main concepts were identified: cultural self-identity, which appeared as an overarching explanatory concept; cultural duty and obligations; cultural values; love and emotional attachments; repayment and reciprocity; and competing demands and roles. These concepts informed a model of cultural caregiving motivations, offering an inductive-based exploration of key cultural motivators and highlighting implications for theory development, future research, policy and practice. The model holds implications for the actual exchange of care. Caregiver motivations should not be taken for granted by healthcare or social care professionals involved in assessment and support planning, educational endeavours at a population level may support caregiving, and support should be sensitive to cultural caregiving motivations.},

  abstract = {Extant evidence on the effectiveness of caregiver programs in alleviating caregiver burden is mixed, underscoring the need for further investigations. This study evaluated the effect of the National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) educational services and respite care on caregiver burden. We used survey data from caregivers assigned to program (n = 491) or comparison (n = 417) group based on their reported use of NFCSP services. Adjusted difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis found an increase in mean burden scores for both groups from baseline to 6 or 12 months. Among program caregivers receiving {$\geq$}4 hr of NFCSP respite care per week (n = 307) and matched comparisons (n = 370), burden scores decreased slightly for program caregivers (-0.095 points), but increased for comparison caregivers (+0.145 points). The DiD (0.239 points) was not statistically significant. More research is needed to determine the minimum amount of respite care needed to positively impact caregiver burden.},

  abstract = {AbstractPatients are commonly accompanied to visit clinicians in Chinese outpatient clinics. Although there has been extensive research on the roles of companions in asymmetric interactions within medical settings, there is a paucity of conversation analytic studies that examine the active participation and contributions of companions on an equal footing in medical consultations. How companions on an equal footing participate and contribute in Chinese outpatient clinical consultations remains under-explored. By employing video recordings of three-party consultations in the Chinese orthopaedic outpatient clinic as the data and adopting conversation analysis as the method, this study investigated how companions participated in and contributed to the information-gathering activity and how their contributions were interactionally negotiated and managed by clinicians and adult patients over sequences of interaction. We showed that companions negotiated epistemic rights in reporting and repairing the information about medical problems in the patients' epistemic domain and displayed different levels of encroachment on patients' epistemic rights by endorsing patients' responses, repairing the information in patients' responses, and offering information directly to clinicians. Companions also exerted deontic authority and shaped the trajectory of the consultations by hindering or facilitating the progressivity of the interaction. We argued that companions' contributions to the information-gathering activity might reflect the family-centred model of the doctor--patient relationship in the Chinese orthopaedic outpatient clinic. Clinicians are suggested to open up opportunities for companions' participation and contributions while respecting patients' rights, especially when there is a collision of knowledge claims between patients and their companions.},

  abstract = {Objectives. We tested the associations of content types of children's television viewing with subsequent body mass index (BMI) to assess the plausibility of different causal pathways., Methods. We used time-use diary data from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics to measure television viewing categorized by format and educational and commercial content. Analyses were stratified by age because children younger than 7 years are less able to understand the persuasive intent of advertising. BMI z scores in 2002 were regressed on television viewing, sociodemographic variables, mother's BMI, and BMI in 1997 (for older children only)., Results. Among children aged 0 to 6 years in 1997, commercial viewing in 1997 was significantly associated with BMI z scores in 2002 in fully adjusted regressions. Among children older than 6 years, commercial viewing in 2002 was associated with 2002 BMI. These results were robust after adjustment for exercise and eating while watching television., Conclusions. The evidence does not support the contention that television viewing contributes to obesity because it is a sedentary activity. Television advertising, rather than viewing per se, is associated with obesity.},

  abstract = {Dementia caregivers widely turn to social media for much needed information and support. Prior research on caregivers' online information exchange has focused on the original questions or posts, without including peer comments in response to those original questions, which does not provide a complete picture of online information exchanges between caregivers and their peers. This paper provides a preliminary analysis of a subset of data from a larger project and suggests how peer comments might match with evidence-based care strategies for memory loss and confusion. A total of 954 peer comments on 114 Reddit posts for dementia memory loss and confusion were collected and mapped with 5 evidence-based strategies generated from 17 care strategies from 3 credible websites. Our results report how well peer comments on Reddit can map to existing evidence-based strategies, and provide preliminary evidence supporting the necessity of providing tailored information based on the patient's characteristics, stages of disease, and the progression level of memory loss and confusion.},
